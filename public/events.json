      "description": "The Point Reyes Library Book Club will discuss Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin on Monday, March 2 from 7 to 8 pm. This book club meeting is online. Facilitator - Lorelei Sontag Contact: Mattie Ivy Leeds at 415-663-8375 or mattie.ivyleeds@marincounty.gov to register, or for more information. About the Book: Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin\"A modern love story about two childhood friends, Sam, raised by an actress mother in LA's Koreatown, and Sadie, from the wealthy Jewish enclave of Beverly Hills, who reunite as adults to create video games, finding an intimacy in digital worlds that eludes them in their real lives, from the New York Times best-selling author of The Storied Life of A.J. Fikry\"-- adapted from book jacket On a bitter-cold day, in the December of his junior year at Harvard, Sam Masur exits a subway car and sees, amid the hordes of people waiting on the platform, Sadie Green. He calls her name. For a moment, she pretends she hasn't heard him, but then, she turns, and a game begins: a legendary collaboration that will launch them to stardom.These friends, intimates since childhood, borrow money, beg favors, and, before even graduating college, they have created their first blockbuster, Ichigo. Overnight, the world is theirs. Not even twenty-five years old, Sam and Sadie are brilliant, successful, and rich, but these qualities won't protect them from their own creative ambitions or the betrayals of their hearts. Spanning thirty years, from Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Venice Beach, California, and lands in between and far beyond, Gabrielle Zevin's Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow is a dazzling and intricately imagined novel that examines the multifarious nature of identity, disability, failure, the redemptive possibilities in play, and above all, our need to connect: to be loved and to love. Yes, it is a love story, but it is not one you have read before. ADA Accommodation Request | Solicitud de Adaptación ADA",

      "description": "Join us for a fun, engaging discussion of Project Hail Mary, by Andy Weir, just in time for the movie release!--- Ryland Grace is the sole survivor on a desperate, last-chance mission—and if he fails, humanity and Earth itself will perish. Except that right now, he doesn’t know that. He can’t even remember his own name, let alone the nature of his assignment or how to complete it. All he knows is that he’s been asleep for a very, very long time. His crewmates dead, his memories fuzzily returning, Ryland realizes that an impossible task now confronts him. Hurtling through space on this tiny ship, it’s up to him to puzzle out an impossible scientific mystery—and conquer an extinction-level threat to our species. And with the clock ticking down and the nearest human being light-years away, he’s got to do it all alone. Or does he?",

      "description": "Join us on the 1st Tuesday of each month at 2:00 pm for The In-Person Davidson Branch Book Club! This month we will be discussing House in the Cerulean Sea by TJ Klune. This is the library's Community Read selection for March. I will have free copies available at our January and February meetings. From Publisher's Weekly: \"Quirk and charm give way to a serious exploration of the dangers of complacency in this delightful, thought-provoking Orwellian fantasy from Klune. Caseworker Linus Baker of the Department in Charge of Magical Youths (DICOMY) believes he is doing right by the preternaturally gifted children placed in DICOMY-sanctioned orphanages. But Linus begins to question DICOMY's methods when the ominous Extremely Upper Management tasks Linus with evaluating the isolated Marsyas Island Orphanage and reporting not only on the island's extraordinary children--among them a female gnome, a blob of uncertain species who wants to be a bellhop, and a shy teenage boy who turns into a small dog when startled--but also on the orphanage master, Arthur Parnassus. The bonds Linus forms with the children and the romantic connection he feels for Arthur set Linus on a path toward redemption for the unwitting harm he caused as a cog in an uncaring bureaucratic machine. By turns zany and heartfelt, this tale of found family is hopeful to its core. Readers will revel in Klune's wit and ingenuity.\"This program will be provided by Davidson library staff.

Current book club selections are available at the Logan Square Branch front desk.Good Talk - Mira Jacob“How brown is too brown?”“Can Indians be racist?”“What does real love between really different people look like?”Like many six-year-olds, Mira Jacob’s half-Jewish, half-Indian son, Z, has questions about everything. At first they are innocuous enough, but as tensions from the 2016 election spread from the media into his own family, they become much, much more complicated. Trying to answer him honestly, Mira has to think back to where she’s gotten her own answers: her most formative conversations about race, color, sexuality, and, of course, love. Written with humor and vulnerability, this deeply relatable graphic memoir is a love letter to the art of conversation—and to the hope that hovers in our most difficult questions.

They're the best of friends, and godmothers to each other's daughters - because they trust that the safety of their children is both of their top priority.But what if their choice could harm your own child?Little do they know that they differ radically over one very important issue. And when Bryony, afraid of being judged, tells what is supposed to be a harmless white lie before a child's birthday party, the consequences are more catastrophic than either of them could ever have imagined . . .",

Read this month's selection, drop in and join the fun! For March 3 the club will be discussing The Castro Valley Reads book selection for 2026, Advice for Future Corpses (and Those Who Love Them) by Sallie Tisdale. Tisdale's book isn't built on a conventional plot; instead, it unfolds as a clear-eyed, compassionate exploration of something universal yet often avoided: dying. Drawing from her long experience as a palliative-care nurse, she guides readers through the practical, emotional, and spiritual realities of the end of life. What emerges is not a manual of dread, but an invitation to look directly at mortality with honesty and even tenderness. The magic of this book lies in Tisdale's voice. She moves with ease between intimate stories from the bedside, philosophical reflections, and grounded, often surprising advice. As she explores the fears, confusions, hopes, and small graces that accompany dying, she reveals the complex inner landscapes of patients, caregivers, and loved ones alike. Her writing is at once candid, lyrical, funny, and deeply humane. Through these interwoven perspectives, we're offered not just practical wisdom but a rare kind of companionship on a topic many of us struggle to face. Ultimately, Advice for Future Corpses is about how to meet mortality—with clarity, courage, humility, and love—and, in doing so, how to live more fully.Advice for Future Corpses* and Those Who Love Them Library staff may take photos, videos, or audio recordings at our events. Please tell us if you do not wish to be photographed, video-recorded, or audio-recorded. We will always respect your requests! An ASL (American Sign Language) interpreter or closed captioning can be provided for this program if requested at least seven (7) days in advance.

      "description": "Our book club meets monthly at the library to discuss books set in Oakland and the Bay Area or by Bay Area authors. We select our books from a variety of genres and eras so you’re sure to find something you’re interested in. We’ll get to learn more about our city, meet some neighbors and discuss what we’ve read. This year we’re mostly alternating fiction and non-fiction books. Meetings are the first Tuesday of the month (note the change from 2025!) from 6:30-7:30pm. Come to one discussion, a few or all of them! No pre-registration or commitment is required – all we ask is that you’ve read at least some of the book and are ready to discuss it. Here’s our 2026 schedule: (Quoted descriptions are from the library catalog unless otherwise noted.) January 6, 2026: Sourdough by Robin Sloan (fiction)We’re kicking off the year with a quick read about the very Bay Area intersection of tech and food culture. Lois is an exhausted software engineer who is gifted a very special sourdough starter by her favorite bakers when they must flee the country. Pretty soon she’s part of a mysterious underground food scene at the former Alameda Naval Air Station. February 3, 2026: Family Style: Memories of An American From Vietnam by Thien Pham (graphic memoir)The book that got the most votes from our members on our year-end poll! “Told through the lens of meaningful food and meals, this graphic novel chronicles the author’s childhood immigration to America, where food takes on new meaning as he and his family search for belonging, for happiness and for the American dream.” Pham is a graphic novelist, comic artist and educator based in Oakland. March 3, 2026: Deep Care: The Radical Activists Who Provided Abortions, Defied the Law, and Fought to Keep Clinics Open by Angela Hume (non-fiction)“The story of the radical feminist networks who worked outside the law to defend abortion. Deep Care follows generations of activists and clinicians who orbited the Women’s Choice clinic in Oakland from the early 1970s until 2010, as they worked underground and above ground, in small cells and broad coalitions and across political movements with grit, conviction, and allegiances of great trust to do what they believed needed to be done–despite the law, when required.” April 7, 2026: Moonglow by Michael Chabon (fiction)“A man bears witness to his grandfather’s deathbed confessions, which reveal his family’s long-buried history and his involvement in a mail-order novelty company, World War II and the space program.” Most of it isn’t set in Oakland, but it is the only book on this list that specifically mentions Montclair Library! May 5, 2026: Automatic Noodle by Annalee Newitz (science fiction)Our May read is a slim 163 pages, but packed with interesting ideas. This book is super popular as of December 2025, so you might want to get your hold in early. “In this semicozy tale set in a dystopian near future, robots open their own restaurant, build an unusual found family and achieve personal growth. A few years after the war that led to California’s secession from the United States, four robots awake in the flooded San Francisco takeout place where they were contracted to work.” (Kirkus) “Emboldened by newly granted civil rights from the California government, the bots reboot their lives in classic Bay Area form: by opening a noodle shop…In many ways, Newitz’s near-future San Francisco resembles today’s city, with not-so-subtle nods to AI anxieties, queer identity and the modern-day immigrant experience. It is, in the words of KQED’s Alexis Madrigal, ‘The most San Francisco book that has ever been or could ever have been written.’” (Leah Worthington) (Ebook listed separately) June 2, 2026: Moneyball by Michael Lewis (non-fiction)Baseball season is in full swing, which makes this the perfect time to read Michael Lewis’s nuanced exploration of “how Billy Beene, the general manager of the Oakland Athletics, used a new kind of thinking to build a successful and winning baseball team without spending enormous sums of money.” July 7, 2026: Girls Girls Girls by Shoshana von Blanckensee (fiction)In the summer of 1996, best friends (and secret girlfriends), Hannah and Sam drive from “New York, to the fabled queer paradise of San Francisco, free from the harsh gazes of their neighbors and the stifling demands of Hannah’s devout Orthodox Jewish mother. In San Francisco, they will finally be together as a real couple, out in the open, around other queer people.” But soon they’re working at a strip club, meeting new people and trying to figure out who just they are. August 4, 2026: Power Hungry: Women of the Black Panther Party and Freedom Summer and Their Fight to Feed a Movement by Suzanne Cope (non-fiction)Journey back with us to the summer of 1969 with the story of the free breakfast movement, grocery giveaways and other nurturing mutual aid programs started by the Black Panthers. “NYU writing professor Cope rescues two female activists from obscurity in this intriguing look at the role that food played in the civil rights and Black Power movements.” If you read One Crazy Summer with us in 2025, you’ll enjoy learning the backstory to the Panthers’ food program. September 1, 2026: Kasher in the Rye by Moshe Kasher (memoir)Go back to school with this “hilarious memoir about the absurdity of addiction.” “When he was a young boy, Kasher’s mother took him on a vacation to the West Coast. Well it was more like an abduction…They moved to Oakland, California. That’s where the real fun begins, in the war zone of Oakland Public Schools. Those early years read like part Augusten Burroughs, part David Sedaris, with a touch of Jim Carrol….Brutally honest and laugh-out-loud funny, Kasher…finds humor in even the most horrifying situations.” October 6, 2026: 107 Days by Kamala Harris (memoir)Hopefully by October the miles-long hold list for this book will have settled down enough for you to get a copy! “For the first time, and with surprising and revealing insights, Kamala Harris tells the story of one of the wildest and most consequential presidential campaigns in American history.” (NPR) November 3, 2026: The Giveaway: The Clay Blackburn Story by Owen Hill (crime fiction)We have something noir-ish by an Oakland author for those long November nights. “Hill’s crime fiction is whip-smart, stylish, subversive, hilarious and just dripping with East Bay color, culture and landmarks. Sweet and sour like a perfect Negroni, Hill has invented a new kind of East Bay Noir — the fog rolls in late, the golden afternoon glow somehow both luxurious and ominous in the class war that never sleeps.” (Recommendation from Tally Ho! Books via Oaklandside) December 1, 2026: Sign My Name to Freedom by Betty Reid Soskin (memoir)Reid Soskin, famous for being the oldest park ranger in the history of the National Park Service while working at the Rosie the Riveter National Park in Richmond, has been witness to a wide sweep of American history. She grew up in the Bay Area, raised four kids, ran a record store in Berkeley and more. “Betty just turned 104 and her memoir gives a fascinating look at African Americans migration, the Rosie the Riveter story, and beyond through the Civil Rights era.” (recommender) (Ebook and audiobook listed separately) « See our 2025 books here »« See our 2024 books here »« See our 2023 books here »Learn more about Montclair Library and its Friends group, FOML, here: About | Friends of Montclair Library",

This program is not led by an instructor--it's a social circle for sharing, building understanding and community. Meet up with other knitters or crocheters for self-directed projects in yarn and thread. Bring your own project to work on--no supplies are provided. While you're here, check out our many crafting books with knitting and crocheting projects to try. We meet weekly, every Wednesday afternoon from 1:00pm to 3:00 pm. This program will take place indoors at the North County Regional Library. Indoor programs will be operating at a reduced attendance capacity and will include social distancing based on the library space. Want to be notified about future events?

      "description": "Join us for a conversation with bestselling author and humorist Michael Perry, whose wide‑ranging work captures the humor, heartbreak, and everyday magic of rural communities. In his memoir Population: 485, Perry introduces readers to unforgettable small‑town characters, from a pistol‑packing vigilante to a cross‑eyed butcher, while navigating fires, wrecks, bar fights, and moments of quiet tenderness that reveal the soul of his hometown. His fiction debut, Jesus Cow, brings the same blend of wit and sincerity to a modern tale of faith and chaos, following Harley Jackson as he contends with love, land‑hungry developers, and a calf born with the image of Jesus Christ on its flank. Together, these works showcase Perry’s gift for finding the extraordinary in ordinary lives.This program is part of Santa Clara County Library District's celebration of Silicon Valley Reads. ---The Santa Clara County Library District is proud to present a free virtual author‑talk series featuring bestselling, award‑winning, and acclaimed writers from around the world, offering live Q&A sessions two to three times a month.

      "description": "RESCHEDULED FROM FEBRUARY Do you want to explore what the horror genre has to offer? Boos and Brews is for you! Join us at the Bellbrook Brewing Company! for Adults 18+.-- This month we are reading Episode Thirteen by Craig DiLouie. Fade to Black is the newest hit ghost hunting reality TV show. It's led by husband and wife team Matt and Claire Kirklin and features a dedicated crew of ghost-hunting experts. Episode Thirteen takes them to Matt's holy grail: the Paranormal Research Foundation. This crumbling, derelict mansion holds secrets and clues about the bizarre experiments that took place there in the 1970s. It's also, undoubtedly, haunted, and Matt hopes to use their scientific techniques and high tech gear to prove it. But, as the house begins to slowly reveal itself to them, proof of an afterlife might not be everything Matt dreamed of. A story told in broken pieces, in tapes, journals, correspondence, and research files, this is the story of Episode Thirteen--and how everything went horribly wrong. Pick up your copy at the Winters Community Library Reference Desk. Boos and Brews meets in the loft at Bellbrook Brewing Company, located at 26 East Franklin Street, Bellbrook, Ohio 45305.

      "description": "New York Times Best Selling Author Doug Tallamy Nature's Best HopeHomegrown National Park Our parks, preserves, and remaining wildlands – no matter how grand in scale – are too small and separated from one another to sustain the native trees, plants, insects, and animals on which our ecosystems depend. We can fix this problem by practicing conservation outside of wildlands, where we live, work, shop, farm, and ranch. Thus, the concept for Homegrown National Park: a national challenge to create diverse ecosystems in our yards, communities, farms, and surrounding lands by reducing lawn, planting native, and removing invasives. The goal of HNP is to create a national movement to restore 20 million acres with natives, an area representing of what is now in lawn, as well as millions more acres in agriculture and woodlots. We are at a critical point where we are losing so many native plant and animal species that our life support systems are in jeopardy. However, if many people make small changes, we can restore healthy ecological networks and weather the changes ahead. Doug Tallamy is the T. A. Baker Professor of Agriculture in the Department of Entomology and Wildlife Ecology at the University of Delaware, where he has authored 118 research publications and has taught insect related courses for 45 years. Chief among his research goals is to better understand the many ways insects interact with plants and how such interactions determine the diversity of animal communities. His books include Bringing Nature Home, The Living Landscape, co-authored with Rick Darke, Nature's Best Hope, a New York Times Best Seller, The Nature of Oaks, winner of the American Horticultural Society’s 2022 book award, and his latest book How Can I Help. In 2021 he cofounded Homegrown National Park with Michelle Alfandari (HomegrownNationalPark.org). His awards include recognition from The Garden Writer’s Association, Audubon, The National Wildlife Federation, Allegheny College, Ecoforesters, The Garden Club of America, The Herb Society, Santa Barbara Botanic Garden, and The American Horticultural Association.",

For March, the Mystery Book Club is reading The Locked Ward by Sarah Pekkanen. \"Was it... Bitter, all-consuming jealousy? Pathological sibling rivalry? Pure insanity? Whatever the cause-and everyone has a theory-it's the Crime of the Decade when glamorous Georgia Cartwright, who was adopted as a newborn, is accused of killing the biological daughter of her wealthy, Southern family. Georgia is locked in a psychiatric institution where the most violent offenders are held while she awaits trial. The only words she whispers when her estranged twin sister Amanda visits are, \"I didn't do it. You've got to get me out of here.\" Amanda doesn't trust Georgia, but she can't abandon her in a place so eerie and menacing that it seems to exist in another dimension. Is Georgia the victim of a powerful family that's so depraved murder is the least of their crimes? Or is Amanda being led down a path of madness into the web of a master manipulator?\" We meet on the first Wednesday of each month at 6:30 – 7:45 PM in the upstairs Conference Room. Contact the Library for more information at kw@hcpl.net",

Promised freedom upon the death of their owner, she and her sister, Ruth, in a cruel twist of fate become the property of a malicious New York City couple, the Locktons, who have no sympathy for the American Revolution and even less for Ruth and Isabel.

She has a standing invitation to the neighborhood coffee klatch, and now, thanks to her husband, a new subscription to A Woman's Place - a magazine that tells housewives like Margaret exactly who to be and what to buy.

Except that right now, he doesn’t know that. He can’t even remember his own name, let alone the nature of his assignment or how to complete it. All he knows is that he’s been asleep for a very, very long time. His crewmates dead, his memories fuzzily returning, Ryland realizes that an impossible task now confronts him. Hurtling through space on this tiny ship, it’s up to him to puzzle out an impossible scientific mystery—and conquer an extinction-level threat to our species. And with the clock ticking down and the nearest human being light-years away, he’s got to do it all alone. Or does he?",

Ruth Rose’s cat, Tiger, has also disappeared. Then the kids hear about two more missing critters. Is there a pet-napper in town? Dink, Josh, and Ruth Rose are on the case! About Our Book Club: Each week, an AAC user hosts our sessions, and a librarian reads our story. After each reading, we enjoy an activity or game connected to the book, celebrating representation, creativity, and the many wonderful ways people communicate. We celebrate all forms of communication—AAC, speech, gestures, and expressions—and follow a Floortime-inspired approach that centers on meeting readers where they are and building joyful shared experiences. When applicable, a visual schedule will be emailed 24 hours before each session to help our readers follow along. Special thanks to Ron Roy and Penguin Random House for allowing us to read A to Z Mysteries: The Canary Caper in our virtual book club.",

Skylark description:The second book in the series that began with the Newbery Medal–winning Sarah, Plain and Tall by Patricia MacLachlan. Sarah came to the prairie from Maine to marry Papa. But that summer, a drought turned the land dry and brown. Fires swept across the fields and coyotes came to the well in search of water. So Sarah took Anna and Caleb back east, where they would be safe. Papa stayed behind. He would not leave his land. Maine was beautiful, but Anna missed home, and Papa. And as the weeks went by, she began to wonder what would happen if the rains never came. Would she and Caleb and Sarah and Papa ever be a family again?",

About the book:Bestselling author Riley Sager returns with a Gothic chiller about a young caregiver assigned to work for a woman accused of a Lizzie Borden-like massacre decades earlier.At seventeen, Lenora HopeHung her sister with a ropeNow reduced to a schoolyard chant, the Hope family murders shocked the Maine coast one bloody night in 1929. While most people assume seventeen-year-old Lenora was responsible, the police were never able to prove it. Other than her denial after the killings, she has never spoken publicly about that night, nor has she set foot outside Hope’s End, the cliffside mansion where the massacre occurred.Stabbed her father with a knifeTook her mother’s happy lifeIt’s now 1983, and home-health aide Kit McDeere arrives at a decaying Hope’s End to care for Lenora after her previous nurse fled in the middle of the night. In her seventies and confined to a wheelchair, Lenora was rendered mute by a series of strokes and can only communicate with Kit by tapping out sentences on an old typewriter. One night, Lenora uses it to make a tantalizing offer—I want to tell you everything.“It wasn’t me,” Lenora saidBut she’s the only one not deadAs Kit helps Lenora write about the events leading to the Hope family massacre, it becomes clear there’s more to the tale than people know. But when new details about her predecessor’s departure come to light, Kit starts to suspect Lenora might not be telling the complete truth—and that the seemingly harmless woman in her care could be far more dangerous than she first thought.",

As a superhero, Tobi becomes super popular thanks to his new friend Grace's social media campaign! But being Go-Man drains him of all his energy, and he's forced to retreat into his bedroom for days. When the monsters keep coming, he feels he needs to help fight them and protect his friends, despite what is best for himself. On top of the chaos the monsters bring, the city's Robug Squad, his father among them, isn't sure that Go-Man is on their side. Can Grace and Okidoki, Tobi's robot monkey friend, help restore Tobi's confidence and win over the Robug Squad?\"Go-Man! Volume 1, Champion of Earth",

In a desperate bid to resolve her family's debt and secure their future for another few months, she becomes a guinea pig in an experiment that alters her face so it cannot be recognized by surveillance. Seeking some reprieve from her recent hardships and from her family's addiction to their devices, she splurges on passes that allow them three nights' respite inside the Botanical Garden: a rare green refuge where forests, streams, and animals flourish. But her insistence that her son, daughter, and husband leave their devices at home proves far more fraught than she anticipated, and the lush beauty of the Botanical Garden is not the balm she hoped it would be.Place a hold or pick up a copy at the Avalon circulation desk.

In March the book will be How to Change Your Mind: What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us About Consciousness, Dying, Addiction, Depression, and Transcendence by Michael Pollan. (2018)Psychadelic drugs such as LSD and psilocybin earned a destructive and frightening reputation during the 1960’s, but Michael Pollan set out to research their more beneficial properties in treating depression, addiction and anxiety. Upon discovering how these remarkable substances are improving the lives not only of the mentally ill but also of healthy people coming to grips with the challenges of everyday life, Pollan decided to explore the landscape of the mind in the first person as well as the third. In this book, he sifts the historical record to separate the truth about these mysterious drugs from the myths that have surrounded them since the 1960s, when a handful of psychedelic evangelists catalyzed a powerful backlash against what was then a promising field of research. The Adult Nonfiction Book Discussion meets on the second Sunday of each month at 11am in Room 201B. All meetings are sponsored by The Friends of the Cupertino Library. For accessibility accommodations (ex. ASL), please fill out the online form at sccld.org/accessibility 7+days prior to the event.

      "description": "Join us for a discussion of the book selection for Castro Valley Reads! Our selection for 2026 is Advice for Future Corpses* (And those who love them) by Sallie Tisdale. From the sublime (the faint sound of Mozart as you take your last breath) to the ridiculous (lessons on how to close the sagging jaw of a corpse), Tisdale leads us through the peaks and troughs of death with a calm, wise, and humorous hand. Advice for Future Corpses is more than a how-to manual or a spiritual bible: it is a graceful compilation of honest and intimate anecdotes based on the deaths Tisdale has witnessed in her work and life, as well as stories from cultures, traditions, and literature around the world. Free copies of the book are available while supplies last. The free copies will be distributed beginning Sunday, February 1, at 2 pm at the CV Reads Kick-Off Event. The book is also available in the Library collection. Advice for Future Corpses* An ASL (American Sign Language) interpreter or closed captioning can be provided for this program if requested at least seven (7) days in advance. For assistance, please contact your library or accessibility@aclibrary.org.",

We will introduce Volume 1 of a series to get you started on your next reading adventure.

Digital reading also counts; we will be happy to have you participate in our discussion if you have read an e-copy. Physical copies of Volume 1 will be available for in person pick-up at the Enon Branch on a first come, first served basis. Check out Libby and Hoopla for available digital copies. Scheduled for the second Monday of the month. For teens. This month's selection: The Apothecary Diaries by Natsu Hyuuga Summary: Maomao, a young woman trained in the art of herbal medicine, is forced to work as a lowly servant in the inner palace. Though she yearns for life outside its perfumed halls, she isn't long for a life of drudgery! Using her wits to break a \"curse\" afflicting the imperial heirs, Maomao attracts the attention of the handsome eunuch Jinshi and is promoted to attendant food taster. But Jinshi has other plans for the erstwhile apothecary, and soon Maomao is back to brewing potions and... solving mysteries?!” Rated 13 +",

      "description": "Do you know the names of the neighborhood dogs but not their human companions? Have you been wanting to ask your neighbor how they keep their garden alive but don’t know how to start the conversation? Do you want to create change but don't know where to start? This is an interactive program to help us get connected, to think about our neighbors and our neighborhoods, how we fit in, how we stand out, how we keep to ourselves, how we come out of our shells and what we can do to make our own small bit of the world a better place. Join us for an evening of light refreshments, conversation, and practice. The US Surgeon General reports that the United States currently has an epidemic of loneliness and isolation. This has a heavy impact on personal health and on communal prosperity. It impacts our democracy, our divisions, and our resilience to hardship. Come hear from two neighbors about how simple connections can improve our own lives and also build resilient supportive communities. Let’s create a collective vision for safety, care, and mutual aid—one neighborly conversation at a time. Whether you’re already building relationships in your neighborhood or feel like you’d like to start, this event is for anyone who wants to strengthen community ties. This program is provided by community presenters Sam Poler and Jada Daire McGirt. About Community ReadCommunity Read is Charlotte Mecklenburg Library’s annual, community-wide book club—an invitation to connect through a shared story. Each year’s book selection inspires programs, community conversations, and events that explore timely and meaningful themes. This year’s title The House in the Cerulean Sea by TJ Klune explores themes of found family, belonging, and self-acceptance. Please join us at programs and events all month long and pick up your free copy at any Charlotte Mecklenburg Library location, while supplies last. Learn more at cmlibrary.org/community-read.",

Don't forget to grab your copy from the children's desk. In a magic kingdom where your name is your destiny, 12-year-old Rump is the butt of everyone's joke. But when he finds an old spinning wheel, his luck seems to change. Rump discovers he has a gift for spinning straw into gold. His best friend, Red Riding Hood, warns him that magic is dangerous, and she's right. With each thread he spins, he weaves himself deeper into a curse. To break the spell, Rump must go on a perilous quest, fighting off pixies, trolls, poison apples, and a wickedly foolish queen. The odds are against him, but with courage and friendship-and a cheeky sense of humor-he just might triumph in the end. A Texas Bluebonnet finalist and winner of the ILA award for middle grade fiction, Rump is perfect for fans of Gail Carson Levine's Ella Enchanted or Adam Gidwitz's A Tale Dark and Grimm.",

Sign up and pick up a copy of Solaris by Stanislaw Lem . Read it and meet us on Monday, March 9th at 7pm in the Auditorium of Milpitas Library. \"What happens when we encounter something we can never truly understand?\" On a distant planet orbiting a strange sun lies an endless, sentient ocean—a living enigma that defies explanation. When psychologist Kris Kelvin arrives at the Solaris Station, he finds a crew on the brink of madness and begins confronting mysteries that are both alien and deeply personal. A haunting exploration of humanity’s limits in the face of the unknown, Solaris is a masterpiece of philosophical science fiction that will leave you questioning the boundaries of knowledge, memory, and meaning. Can we ever truly communicate with the other—or are we destined to see only ourselves? For accessibility accommodations (ex.

Everyone says so: her parents, the villagers, and her horrible cousin who kicks her out of her own house. Determined to get some semblance of independence, Jane prepares to propose to the princely Peter. It's a good plan!Or it would've been, if he wasn't kidnapped by a mermaid. Jane must venture underwater to rescue her maybe-fiancé. But the depths of the ocean hold beautiful mysteries and dangerous creatures. What good can a plain Jane do?",

      "description": "The Page Turners is an evening book discussion group for adults that meets at the Castro Valley Library on the second Tuesday of the month at 7 pm. Facilitated by librarian Chris Selig, the discussions focus on compelling, well-reviewed fiction and nonfiction books written for adults.For March we will discuss the Castro Valley Reads book selection for 2026, Advice for Future Corpses (and Those Who Love Them) by Sallie Tisdale. Tisdale's book isn't built on a conventional plot; instead, it unfolds as a clear-eyed, compassionate exploration of something universal yet often avoided: dying. Drawing from her long experience as a palliative-care nurse, she guides readers through the practical, emotional, and spiritual realities of the end of life. What emerges is not a manual of dread, but an invitation to look directly at mortality with honesty and even tenderness. The magic of this book lies in Tisdale's voice. She moves with ease between intimate stories from the bedside, philosophical reflections, and grounded, often surprising advice. As she explores the fears, confusions, hopes, and small graces that accompany dying, she reveals the complex inner landscapes of patients, caregivers, and loved ones alike. Her writing is at once candid, lyrical, funny, and deeply humane. Through these interwoven perspectives, we're offered not just practical wisdom but a rare kind of companionship on a topic many of us struggle to face.

Touching the objects is always optional. Hand sanitizer will be provided. This wildly fun, free Environmental Education Program is designed for preschoolers and up and their caregiver(s).

      "description": "Are you a reader looking for a murder mystery to solve, a thrill to seek, or a story full of suspense? If you answer yes to any or all these questions, you must join Edgebrook Branch's Wednesday Afternoon Murder Mystery Book Club! For March, we are reading and discussing Jar of Hearts by Jennifer Hillier. \"Angela was one of the most popular girls in her high school before she disappeared without a trace. Nobody ever knew what became of her—not Georgina, her best friend, nor Kaiser, who was close with both girls. Then, fourteen years later, Angela’s remains were discovered in the woods near Geo’s childhood home and Kaiser—who became a detective with the Seattle police department—finally learned the truth: Angela was a victim of Calvin James. To the authorities, Calvin was a notorious serial killer. But back in the day, Calvin was Geo’s first love. Their relationship bordered on obsession from the moment they met, right up until the night Angela was killed. Geo carried the secret of Calvin’s dark deeds until the evidence landed her in prison. But now, just as Geo is about to be released, new bodies start turning up—killed in the exact same manner as Angela...and soon Geo, Kaiser, and local law enforcement officials realize that what happened that fateful night is more complex and chilling than anyone could have imagined.\" - Description from MacMillan Publishers. Copies of the book will be available at Edgebrook Branch's reference desk starting on 3/12/26 while supplies last.

But the Rising has shattered everything, and brought endless war. New foes emerge to threaten what has been earned, and throughout the worlds other destinies entwine with Darrow's to change his fate forever. A young Red girl flees tragedy in her refugee camp, and achieves for herself a new life she could never have imagined. An ex-soldier broken by grief is forced to steal the most valuable thing in the galaxy -- or pay with his life. And Lysander au Lune, the heir in exile to the Sovereign, wanders the stars with his mentor, Cassius, haunted by the loss of the world that Darrow transformed, and dreaming of what will rise from its ashes.",

We meet once a month on a Wednesday in the months of October, November, December, February, March, and April at 6 p.m. We have a limited supply of free books for book club participants that will be available for pick up at the Dayton's Bluff Branch Library when selections become finalized. Participants will be notified by email. Books will also be available to borrow at the library. The Dayton’s Bluff Book Club is a collaboration of the Metropolitan State University Library and the Dayton’s Bluff Branch of Saint Paul Public Library whose members live, work or attend classes on the East Side. We prioritize our selection of titles to those written by Minnesota authors, that have a local setting, or that are written by people of color and other diverse authors. Book discussions usually include issues related to social justice, equity, and anti-racism. We encourage book club members to use both the university and public libraries in pursuit of lifelong learning and the joy of reading. Discussions are frequently facilitated by authors, Metropolitan State faculty, or other guests from the community.

      "description": "Everyone is welcome to join our online (Zoom) book discussion group on Wednesday March 11, 2026. For more information and a Zoom invite, contact Davo Knepler at nuevodavos@yahoo.com.We will be discussing The Last Dekrepitzer by Howard Langer. The author will be joining us for the discussion. WINNER NATIONAL JEWISH BOOK AWARD The fiddler busking in the Columbus Circle subway station in 1965 is the Dekrepitzer Rebbe, the sole survivor of the obscure Dekrepitzer Hasidic sect known before the war for its rebbes' fiddling. The Last Dekrepitzer follows the life and spiritual quest of Shmuel Meir Lichtbencher a/k/a Sam Lightup, from his isolated shtetl in the mountains of southern Poland, where he is brought up to be the future rebbe, to the wharves in Naples, where he jams with Black soldiers waiting to ship home at the end of the war. Dressing him in the uniform and dog tags of an AWOL soldier, they smuggle him home to rural Mississippi. He lives for years among the Blacks, speaks Black English, preaches and plays the blues with the Brown Sugar Ramblers trio. His marriage to a Black woman, Lula Curtin, legal by Jewish law though forbidden under Mississippi law, results in a cross burning that forces them to flee to Manhattan. He plays on the streets of Harlem and Midtown with the Reverend Gary Davis, the great blind guitarist whose mission is saving souls for the next world. Shmuel Meir's devout wife, though she knows herself to be the Dekrepitzer Rebbitzen, is spurned by the Jewish community. Through it all, Shmuel Meir fiddles his prayers in defiance of God. But God gives the Dekrepitzer Rebbe no peace.For more information and a Zoom invite, contact Davo Knepler at nuevodavos@yahoo.com. Everyone is welcome to attend.

Cozy mysteries are generally considered “gentle” books and most have no graphic violence. The setting is often a small town full of colorful characters.Series frequently have a prominent thematic element introduced by the detective's job, pet, or hobby.These books are plot and character driven with an emphasis on solving puzzles rather than suspense. Our chosen book with serve as our theme for the meeting, we will talk about other book series with a similar theme as well as the recipes, crafts, and more included in many cozies.",

Promised freedom upon the death of their owner, she and her sister, Ruth, in a cruel twist of fate become the property of a malicious New York City couple, the Locktons, who have no sympathy for the American Revolution and even less for Ruth and Isabel.

We'll feature different titles and authors each month. Join us to share your impressions, thoughts and interpretations of a book we have all read. \"On Book Banning\" by Ira Wells SYNOPSIS: From the destruction of libraries in ancient Rome to today’s state-sponsored efforts to suppress LGBTQ+ literature, book bans arise from the impulse toward social control. In a survey of legal cases, literary controversies, and philosophical arguments, Ira Wells illustrates the historical opposition to the freedom to read and argues that today’s conservatives and progressives alike are warping our children’s relationship with literature and teaching them that the solution to opposing viewpoints is outright expurgation. At a moment in which our democratic institutions are buckling under the stress of polarization, On Book Banning is both rallying cry and guide to resistance for those who will always insist upon reading for themselves.",

Interested participants should stop by the Hall Center or email pkenn@lplks.org while supplies last. An interdisciplinary panel of speakers will lead the discussion. As monuments of white Western history fall, many are asking: how is Shakespeare still relevant? In The Great White Bard: How to Love Shakespeare While Talking About Race, Farah Karim-Cooper acknowledges how the playwright has come to occupy such an elevated place in the Western canon, and what is lost when he is treated as representative of only one tradition or one group. Karim-Cooper examines race in Shakespeare’s plays through close readings of works such as Antony and Cleopatra and The Tempest, alongside a reappraisal of Elizabethan London and its social world. She argues that Shakespeare should neither be idealized nor discarded, but read with attention to the discomforts in his language and theatrical culture. As The New York Times writes, “The Great White Bard contributes to an essential discussion on Shakespeare and race.” By opening the plays to new perspectives, the book makes space for debate and reInterpretation, and for a Shakespeare who can still speak to the present. Farah Karim-Cooper is the Director of the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C. and a leading scholar of race and performance in early modern drama. The Great White Bard: Shakespeare, Race and the Future was named one of the best books of the year by Time, NPR, The New Yorker, Kirkus Reviews, and Publishers Weekly.",

Each month we'll read a book set in a different country then enjoy conversations about the book as well as other cultures and experiences. We'll read from multiple categories, including fiction, nonfiction, graphic novels, novels in verse, and more. This month we'll be reading and discussing Temple Alley Summer by Sachiko Kashiwaba and set in Japan. Please register then stop by the library for a free copy of the book no earlier than one month before the discussion.One rainy night, Kazu sees a strange figure in a white kimono sneak out of his house--was he dreaming? Did he see a ghost? The next day at school, the very same person is sitting in his class--and all his friends are convinced that the ghost-girl Akari has been their friend for years. If that isn't weird enough, Kazu learns that his house is in the exact location of an ancient temple called Kimyō, which, legend has it, could bring the dead back to life! Kazu sets out to discover what happened to Kimyō Temple and if the rumors of its power are true. His investigation draws the unwanted attention of his neighbor Ms. Minakami and his mysterious new classmate Akari, who is definitely not what she seems. Now, Kazu and Akari must join forces to find and protect the source of the temple's power, before it's too late. Temple Alley Summer An ASL (American Sign Language) interpreter can be provided for this program if requested at least seven (7) business days in advance.

Alexandria “Alix” Watson has learned one lesson from her barren childhood in the foster-care system: unlike people, books will never let you down. Working three dead-end jobs to make ends meet and knowing college is a pipe dream, Alix takes nightly refuge in the high-vaulted reading room at the Boston Public Library, escaping into her favorite fantasy novels and dreaming of far-off lands.

The Librarian takes a dazzled Alix under her wing, but before she can escape into the pages of her new life, a shadowy enemy emerges to threaten everyone the Astral Library has ever helped protect. Aided by a dashing costume-shop owner, Alix and the Librarian flee through the Regency drawing rooms of Jane Austen to the back alleys of Sherlock Holmes and the champagne-soaked parties of The Great Gatsby as danger draws inexorably closer.

      "description": "Hello Book Club Families, Book of the Week: A to Z Mysteries: The Canary CaperC is for Canary . . . Green Lawn has a pet problem! Dink’s neighbor can’t find her canary. Ruth Rose’s cat, Tiger, has also disappeared. Then the kids hear about two more missing critters. Is there a pet-napper in town? Dink, Josh, and Ruth Rose are on the case! About Our Book Club: Each week, an AAC user hosts our sessions, and a librarian reads our story. After each reading, we enjoy an activity or game connected to the book, celebrating representation, creativity, and the many wonderful ways people communicate. We celebrate all forms of communication—AAC, speech, gestures, and expressions—and follow a Floortime-inspired approach that centers on meeting readers where they are and building joyful shared experiences. When applicable, a visual schedule will be emailed 24 hours before each session to help our readers follow along. Special thanks to Ron Roy and Penguin Random House for allowing us to read A to Z Mysteries: The Canary Caper in our virtual book club.",

Join us to share your impressions, thoughts and interpretations of a book we have all read. \"Fahrenheit 451\" by Ray BradburySYNOPSIS: Guy Montag is a fireman. His job is to destroy the most illegal of commodities, the printed book, along with the houses in which they are hidden. Montag never questions the destruction and ruin his actions produce, returning each day to his bland life and wife, Mildred, who spends all day with her television \"family.\" But when he meets an eccentric young neighbor, Clarisse, who introduces him to a past where people didn't live in fear and to a present where one sees the world through the ideas in books instead of the mindless chatter of television, Montag begins to question everything he has ever known.",

      "description": "Point Reyes is known for its organic farms and food, its natural beauty preserved in public parks, its creative communities, and its Instagram-ready attractions. If one looks back in history, the area surrounding Tomales Bay is also notable for the resilience of its Indigenous community, for the creation of the western dairy industry and its technological innovations, for the 1960s rock stars who lived in or frequented the area, and as a superb living example of America’s melting pot, where immigrants settled to find better lives—and succeeded.Dewey’s new book, Point Reyes And Tomales Bay, chronicles the land and people of Point Reyes, Tomales Bay, and the towns that were and still are very different from each other: Olema, Marshall, Point Reyes Station, and Inverness.California historian Dewey Livingston has been fascinated with Marin history since high school, spending the past 55 years exploring and researching his home, especially West Marin. For decades a National Park Service historian specializing in the rural West, and ten years as a MCFL map archivist, he spent the past ten years on a comprehensive history of the Point Reyes area.Sponsored by Friends of the Fairfax Library.

Skylark description:The second book in the series that began with the Newbery Medal–winning Sarah, Plain and Tall by Patricia MacLachlan. Sarah came to the prairie from Maine to marry Papa. But that summer, a drought turned the land dry and brown. Fires swept across the fields and coyotes came to the well in search of water. So Sarah took Anna and Caleb back east, where they would be safe. Papa stayed behind. He would not leave his land. Maine was beautiful, but Anna missed home, and Papa. And as the weeks went by, she began to wonder what would happen if the rains never came. Would she and Caleb and Sarah and Papa ever be a family again?",

Registration required. --- This month we're reading Night Chef by Mika Song. \"Ratatouille meets the magic of Studio Ghibli as a lonely raccoon who secretly lives inside a fine French restaurant and yearns to be a chef must venture into the woods for the first time to help a baby crow find its home. The Night Chef has never had a family— only a dream. She's spent years living inside the walls of a human restaurant, honing her cooking skills. She knows she can fry an omelette with the best of them— but she also knows that humans will never accept her. And so she keeps to herself, hidden and alone. Then, one evening, when Night Chef cracks an egg open for her dinner, a baby crow named Ichi falls out! Despite being reluctant to leave her home, Night Chef steps into the wilds in order to reunite Ichi with his family. And along the journey, she might just find a family to call her own, too.\"",

From the sublime (the faint sound of Mozart as you take your last breath) to the ridiculous (lessons on how to close the sagging jaw of a corpse), Tisdale leads us through the peaks and troughs of death with a calm, wise, and humorous hand. Advice for Future Corpses is more than a how-to manual or a spiritual bible: it is a graceful compilation of honest and intimate anecdotes based on the deaths Tisdale has witnessed in her work and life, as well as stories from cultures, traditions, and literature around the world. Free copies of the book are available while supplies last. The free copies will be distributed beginning Sunday, February 1, at 2 pm at the CV Reads Kick-Off Event. The book is also available in the Library collection. Advice for Future Corpses* An ASL (American Sign Language) interpreter or closed captioning can be provided for this program if requested at least seven (7) days in advance.

From the sublime (the faint sound of Mozart as you take your last breath) to the ridiculous (lessons on how to close the sagging jaw of a corpse), Tisdale leads us through the peaks and troughs of death with a calm, wise, and humorous hand. Advice for Future Corpses is more than a how-to manual or a spiritual bible: it is a graceful compilation of honest and intimate anecdotes based on the deaths Tisdale has witnessed in her work and life, as well as stories from cultures, traditions, and literature around the world. Free copies of the book are available while supplies last. The free copies will be distributed beginning Sunday, February 1, at 2 pm at the CV Reads Kick-Off Event. The book is also available in the Library collection. Advice for Future Corpses* An ASL (American Sign Language) interpreter or closed captioning can be provided for this program if requested at least seven (7) days in advance.

      "description": "Love reading? Love to talk about books you've read? Join our book club for spirited discussions on a wide range of fiction and non-fiction. Each month we'll tackle a new title. Whether you loved it, loathed it, or left it unfinished, we want to hear your take. Come share your impressions and connect with fellow readers! This week we will be reading Born A Crime by Trevor Noah. \"One of the comedy world's fastest-rising stars tells his wild coming of age story during the twilight of apartheid in South Africa and the tumultuous days of freedom that followed. Noah provides something deeper than traditional memorists: powerfully funny observations about how farcical political and social systems play out in our lives. Trevor Noah is the host of The Daily Show with Trevor Noah, where he gleefully provides America with its nightly dose of serrated satire. He is a light-footed but cutting observer of the relentless absurdities of politics, nationalism and race--and in particular the craziness of his own young life, which he's lived at the intersections of culture and history. In his first book, Noah tells his coming of age story with his larger-than-life mother during the last gasps of apartheid-era South Africa and the turbulent years that followed. Noah was born illegal--the son of a white, Dutch father and a black Xhosa mother, who had to pretend to be his nanny or his father's servant in the brief moments when the family came together. His brilliantly eccentric mother loomed over his life--a comically zealous Christian (they went to church six days a week and three times on Sunday), a savvy hustler who kept food on their table during rough times, and an aggressively involved, if often seriously misguided, parent who set Noah on his bumpy path to stardom. The stories Noah tells are sometimes dark, occasionally bizarre, frequently tender, and always hilarious--whether he's subsisting on caterpillars during months of extreme poverty or making comically pitiful attempts at teenage romance in a color-obsessed world; whether's he's being thrown into jail as the hapless fall guy for a crime he didn't commit or being thrown by his mother from a speeding car driven by murderous gangsters.\"",

But what does an owl really know? And what do we really know about owls? Some two hundred sixty species of owls exist today, and they reside on every continent except Antarctica, but they are far more difficult to find and study than other birds because they are cryptic, camouflaged, and mostly active at night. Though human fascination with owls goes back centuries, scientists have only recently begun to understand the complex nature of these extraordinary birds.",

Secretly, he also wants Vis to discover what happed to his brother who died at the academy. He is sure the current Principalis of the academy, Quintus Veridius Julii, a political rival, knows much more than he's revealing. The Academy's vigorous syllabus is a challenge Vis is ably suited to meet, but it is the training in the use of Will, a practice that Vis finds abhorrent, that he must learn in order to excel at the Academy. Will, a concept that encompasses their energy, drive, focus, initiative, ambition, and vitality, can be voluntarily \"ceded\" to someone else. A single recipient can accept ceded Will from multiple people, growing in power towards superhuman levels. Within the hierarchy your level of Will, or legal rank, determines how you live or die. And there are those who are determined to destroy this hierarchal system, as well as those in the Academy who use it to gain dominance in internationally bestselling author James Islington's wonderfully crafted new epic fantasy series\"--",

For centuries, works of art have been stolen in countless ways from all over the world, but no one has been quite as successful at it as the master thief Stéphane Breitwieser. Carrying out more than two hundred heists over nearly eight years—in museums and cathedrals all over Europe—Breitwieser, along with his girlfriend who worked as his lookout, stole more than three hundred objects, until it all fell apart in spectacular fashion. In The Art Thief, Michael Finkel brings us into Breitwieser’s strange and fascinating world.",

We'll feature different titles and authors each month. Come and share your impressions, thoughts and interpretations of a book we have all read. This week we will be reading The Stars Are Fire by Anita ShreveIn October, 1947, after a summer-long drought, fires began near Bar Harbor and raced along the coast of Maine, ravaging two hundred thousand acres--the largest fire in Maine's history. In the southern part of the state, people were forced into the sea to escape the flames. Five months pregnant, Grace Holland is left alone to protect her two toddlers when her husband Gene joins the volunteers fighting to bring the fire under control. When dawn comes, they have miraculously survived, but their lives are forever changed: homeless, penniless, and left to face an uncertain future in a town that no longer exists. As Grace awaits news of her husband's fate, she is thrust into a new world in which she must make a life on her own, beginning with absolutely nothing--she must find work, a home, a way to provide for her children. In the midst of devastating loss, Grace discovers glorious new freedoms--joys and triumphs she could never have expected her narrow life with Gene could contain--and her spirit soars. And then the unthinkable happens, and Grace's bravery is tested as never before",

Bostwick carves an unforgettable path for her characters.\"--Adriana Trigiani, bestselling author of The Good Left Undone Margaret Ryan never really meant to start a book club . . . or a feminist revolution in her buttoned-up suburb. By 1960s standards, Margaret Ryan is living the American woman's dream. She has a husband, three children, a station wagon, and a home in Concordia--one of Northern Virginia's most exclusive and picturesque suburbs. She has a standing invitation to the neighborhood coffee klatch, and now, thanks to her husband, a new subscription to A Woman's Place--a magazine that tells housewives like Margaret exactly who to be and what to buy. On paper, she has it all. So why doesn't that feel like enough...Join us for a lively discussion. Copies available in multiple formats.",

      "description": "In March, the Cupertino Book Discussion Group will talk about R.F. Kuang's novel Yellowface,(2023) A satirical but sharp critique of both the publishing industry and the racism of both publishers and the reading public. Struggling novelist June Hayward is celebrating her fellow Yale alumna Athena Liu's lucrative new movie deal when Athena chokes to death in a freak accident. June, desperately jealous of Athena's tremendous literary success, steals the mostly finished manuscript of Athena’s next novel and re-writes parts of it before getting it published under the pseudonym Juniper Song. Finally enjoying the literary success she’d envied before, June finds the price of borrowed literary glory is steep, but despite her guilty conscience, she's ready to protect her newfound success at all costs. The Adult Book Discussion Group meets on the third Wednesday of each month at 11 am and on the third Thursday at 7pm in Room 201B. Adults of all ages are welcome. All meetings are sponsored by the Friends of the Cupertino Library. For accessibility accommodations (ex. ASL), please fill out the online form at sccld.org/accessibility 7+days prior to the event. If you need assistance with the form, speak with a staff member at your local library, call (408) 540-3945, or email us at ask@sccl.org.",

Mandel's novel, Station Eleven, is an audacious, darkly glittering novel set in the eerie days following civilization's collapse. It tells the spellbinding story of a nomadic group of actors roaming the scattered outposts of the Great Lakes region, risking everything for art and humanity. I am looking forward to hear what about this novel intrigues you most. ADA Accommodation Requests",

Next Chapter Book Club offers community-based book clubs for adolescents and adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Our members (including some who cannot read) love the way books transport them to different worlds where they meet interesting characters and learn about exciting new things. Taking that journey with a group of friends makes it even more delightful and fun. Join us online (click this link to connect to the virtual book club) Wednesdays 5-6 pm until we reach the end of the book. Estimated end date in March.

Promised freedom upon the death of their owner, she and her sister, Ruth, in a cruel twist of fate become the property of a malicious New York City couple, the Locktons, who have no sympathy for the American Revolution and even less for Ruth and Isabel. When Isabel meets Curzon, a slave with ties to the Patriots, he encourages her to spy on her owners, who know details of British plans for invasion. She is reluctant at first, but when the unthinkable happens to Ruth, Isabel realizes her loyalty belongs to whoever can provide her with freedom.",

      "description": "Want to connect with others over the love of reading? Join our book club to discuss Jack Wang's book The Riveter. This title should be on shelves and ready to borrow approximately 5 weeks prior to the discussion date. Check with a staff member if you have questions on how to access a copy.Book Description: \"A cross-cultural love story set against the dramatic backdrop of the Allied invasion of Europe in WWII. Vancouver, 1942. Josiah Chang arrives in the bustling city ready to serve his country in the war against fascism, but Chinese Canadians are barred from joining the army out of fear they might expect citizenship in return. So, Josiah heads to the shipyard to find work as a riveter, fastening together the ribs and steel plates of Victory ships. One night, Josiah spots Poppy singing at a navy club. Despite their different backgrounds, they fall for each other instantly and begin a starry-eyed romance that lasts until the harsh reality of their situation is made clear. Determined to prove himself, Josiah takes a train to Toronto where he’s finally given the chance to enlist. After volunteering for the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion and jumping into Normandy on D-Day, he must fight through the battlefields of Europe to make it back to the woman he loves. By turns harrowing and exhilarating, The Riveter explores what one man must sacrifice to belong to the only country he has ever called home.\" -- Provided by Publisher",

      "description": "The Civic Center Library's Afternoon Book Club will meet in person on Thursday, March 19th from 1:00-2:00 to discuss Salvage the Bones by Jesmyn Ward. This afternoon book club generally meets on the 3rd Thursday of every month from 1:00-2:00pm. All are welcome to join! Request a copy of the book online or ask at the Info Desk of the Civic Center Library (or call 415-473-6057) for assistance in placing a hold. Salvage the Bones (book) or Salvage the Bones (ebook) or Salvage the Bones (eAudiobook) or Salvage the Bones (Audiobook on CD) or Salvage the Bones (Audiobook on MP3 CD) or Salvage the Bones (large print) by Jesmyn Ward A gritty but tender story of family and poverty in the days leading up to Hurricane Katrina. Winner of the National Book Award. A hurricane is building over the Gulf of Mexico, threatening the coastal town of Bois Sauvage, Mississippi, and Esch's father is growing concerned. A hard drinker, largely absent, he doesn't show concern for much else. Esch and her three brothers are stocking food, but there isn't much to save. Lately, Esch can't keep down what food she gets; she's fourteen and pregnant. Her brother Skeetah is sneaking scraps for his prized pitbull's new litter, dying one by one in the dirt. Meanwhile, brothers Randall and Junior try to stake their claim in a family long on child's play and short on parenting. As the twelve days that make up the novel's framework yield to their dramatic conclusion, this family, made up of motherless children sacrificing for one another as they can and protecting and nurturing where love is scarce, pulls itself up to face another day. Poetic and real, this is a big-hearted novel about familial love and community against all odds, and a revelatory look at the lonesome, brutal, and restrictive realities of rural poverty. - adapted from the publisher ADA Accommodation Request | Solicitud de Adaptación ADA",

      "description": "Want to connect with others over the love of reading? Join our book club to discuss Robert Macfarlane's Is a River Alive? This title should be on shelves and ready to borrow approximately 5 weeks prior to the discussion date. Check with a staff member if you have questions on how to access a copy.Book Description\"From the celebrated nature writer, observer and advocate Robert Macfarlane, a brilliant, immersive and paradigm-shifting book that says an emphatic yes to the question it asks. Robert Macfarlane writes, \"At the heart of Is A River Alive? is a single, powerful idea: that rivers, forests, glaciers and mountains are living beings, and that as such they have rights that should be recognized both in imagination and in law. The river has the right to flow unimpeded to the sea; the old-growth forest the right not to be felled; the mountain the right not to be disembowelled for coal.\" This idea -- known as the Rights of Nature -- is driving a conceptual and legal revolution, largely led by Indigenous and non-white activists who are succeeding at challenging the Western legal system to think beyond the idea of nature as material for humans to exploit to a future where regarding all of nature as a living entity may ensure our survival. The book flows like water, from the mountains to the sea, following three major journeys Macfarlane undertakes with local activists: to Ecuador where a recent court decision protects the ancient cedars of the cloud forests from Canadian mining activity; to India, where the fight to revive rivers that start in the glaciers of the Himalayas and empty into the ocean and polluted lagoons of Chennai is not yet won; and to northeastern Quebec where in 2021 an alliance between the local Innu nation and the regional municipal council declared the Mutehekau (Magpie) River a living being, with legal rights. Along with the voices of his fellow travellers, Macfarlane's own voice and incomparable gifts of expression carry immeasurable power to open hearts, spark conversations and challenge perspectives, making Is A River Alive? not only a wondrous literary experience but a powerful rallying cry in the environmental justice movement\"--Provided by publisher.",

Ruth Rose’s cat, Tiger, has also disappeared. Then the kids hear about two more missing critters. Is there a pet-napper in town? Dink, Josh, and Ruth Rose are on the case! About Our Book Club: Each week, an AAC user hosts our sessions, and a librarian reads our story. After each reading, we enjoy an activity or game connected to the book, celebrating representation, creativity, and the many wonderful ways people communicate. We celebrate all forms of communication—AAC, speech, gestures, and expressions—and follow a Floortime-inspired approach that centers on meeting readers where they are and building joyful shared experiences. When applicable, a visual schedule will be emailed 24 hours before each session to help our readers follow along. Special thanks to Ron Roy and Penguin Random House for allowing us to read A to Z Mysteries: The Canary Caper in our virtual book club.",

      "description": "In March, the Cupertino Book Discussion Group will talk about R.F. Kuang's novel Yellowface,(2023) A satirical but sharp critique of both the publishing industry and the racism of both publishers and the reading public. Struggling novelist June Hayward is celebrating her fellow Yale alumna Athena Liu's lucrative new movie deal when Athena chokes to death in a freak accident. June, desperately jealous of Athena's tremendous literary success, steals the mostly finished manuscript of Athena’s next novel and re-writes parts of it before getting it published under the pseudonym Juniper Song. Finally enjoying the literary success she’d envied before, June finds the price of borrowed literary glory is steep, but despite her guilty conscience, she's ready to protect her newfound success at all costs. The Adult Book Discussion Group meets on the third Wednesday of each month at 11 am and on the third Thursday at 7pm in Room 201B. Adults of all ages are welcome. All meetings are sponsored by the Friends of the Cupertino Library. For accessibility accommodations (ex. ASL), please fill out the online form at sccld.org/accessibility 7+days prior to the event.

Skylark description:The second book in the series that began with the Newbery Medal–winning Sarah, Plain and Tall by Patricia MacLachlan. Sarah came to the prairie from Maine to marry Papa. But that summer, a drought turned the land dry and brown. Fires swept across the fields and coyotes came to the well in search of water. So Sarah took Anna and Caleb back east, where they would be safe. Papa stayed behind. He would not leave his land. Maine was beautiful, but Anna missed home, and Papa. And as the weeks went by, she began to wonder what would happen if the rains never came. Would she and Caleb and Sarah and Papa ever be a family again?",

This week we will be reading Nine Perfect Strangers by Liane MoriartyNine people gather at a remote health resort. Some are here to lose weight, some are here to get a reboot on life, some are here for reasons they can't even admot to themselves. Amid all the luxury and pampering, the mindfulness and meditation, they know these ten days might involve some real work. But none of them could imagine just how challenging the next ten days are going to be. Frances Welty, the formerly bestselling romantic novelist, arrives at Tranquillum House and is immediately intrigued by her fellow guests, including the charismatic owner and director. Could this person really have the answers Frances didn't even know she was seeking? Should Frances put aside her doubts and immerse herself in everything Tranquillum House has to offer--or should she run while she still can? And it's not long before every guest is asking the same question.",

In their second adventure, Challenger et al. discover that the planet is about to pass through a belt of poisonous ether which will destroy all life on Earth. However, Challenger has transformed his wife's dressing room into an airtight chamber, so they can witness the end of the world.

Because the questions that power this book are not only at play in Oakland. Racialized capitalism drives the development of cities, and cities drive the creation of wealth for most Americans through the property they own in them. At the same time, globalization and automation have run a cargo ship through the former raison d'etre for cities: manufacturing things and housing the people who worked in the factories. What are cities becoming when the big money is made inside a screen or manufactured somewhere in Asia? What is a city, and this city, for? And what does Oakland owe to its residents, whether or not they own property?\"The group will discuss The Pacific Circuit over the course of 3 meetings :February 23, 6:30-7:45March 23, 6:30-7:45April 27, 6:30-7:45Registration is not required, but is encouraged so that we can estimate interest, as well as contact you via email with updates prior to the meeting.This group is brought to you by the Fremont Main Library and Compassionate Fremont. We will continue to read and meet to discuss various books on the 4th Monday of every month from February through October 2026.

      "description": "Join us for a special conversation between award-winning journalist Shoshana Walter and bestselling, award-winning author Barbara Kingsolver as they discuss Walter’s book Rehab: An American Scandal. Walter, a Pulitzer Prize finalist, exposes the nation’s failed response to the opioid crisis and the corruption, neglect, and exploitation that permeate the drug rehabilitation industry. Although more people have access to treatment than ever before, many programs still ignore proven strategies and instead punish or take advantage of those seeking help. Through the stories of four individuals from different backgrounds, Walter illustrates how the treatment system often prevents recovery rather than supporting it, revealing deep inequities, regulatory failures, and the human cost of a system in need of urgent reform.This program is part of Santa Clara County Library District's celebration of Silicon Valley Reads. ---The Santa Clara County Library District is proud to present a free virtual author‑talk series featuring bestselling, award‑winning, and acclaimed writers from around the world, offering live Q&A sessions two to three times a month. Event links are sent about 24 hours in advance (or upon late registration), recordings are available for a limited time, and a full list of upcoming programs can be found here. ---For accessibility accommodations (ex. ASL), please fill out the online form at sccld.org/accessibility 7+ days prior to the event. If you need assistance with the form, speak with a staff member at your local library, call (408) 540-3945, or email us at ask@lib.sccgov.org.",

      "description": "Love watching true crime documentaries and tv shows? Can't get enough of true crime podcasts? This is a monthly book group focused on reading and discussing True Crime. Join us on Zoom to discuss The Poisoner's Handbook: Murder and the Birth of Forensic Medicine in Jazz Age New York by Deborah Blum.The Poisoner's Handbook \"Deborah Blum, writing with the high style and skill for suspense that is characteristic of the very best mystery fiction, shares the untold story of how poison rocked Jazz Age New York City. In The Poisoner's Handbook Blum draws from highly original research to track the fascinating, perilous days when a pair of forensic scientists began their trailblazing chemical detective work, fighting to end an era when untraceable poisons offered an easy path to the perfect crime.Drama unfolds case by case as the heroes of The Poisoner's Handbook—chief medical examiner Charles Norris and toxicologist Alexander Gettler—investigate a family mysteriously stricken bald, Barnum and Bailey's Famous Blue Man, factory workers with crumbling bones, a diner serving poisoned pies, and many others. Each case presents a deadly new puzzle and Norris and Gettler work with a creativity that rivals that of the most imaginative murderer, creating revolutionary experiments to tease out even the wiliest compounds from human tissue. Yet in the tricky game of toxins, even science can't always be trusted, as proven when one of Gettler's experiments erroneously sets free a suburban housewife later nicknamed \"America's Lucretia Borgia\" to continue her nefarious work.From the vantage of Norris and Gettler's laboratory in the infamous Bellevue Hospital it becomes clear that killers aren't the only toxic threat to New Yorkers. Modern life has created a kind of poison playground, and danger lurks around every corner. Automobiles choke the city streets with carbon monoxide; potent compounds, such as morphine, can be found on store shelves in products ranging from pesticides to cosmetics. Prohibition incites a chemist's war between bootleggers and government chemists while in Gotham's crowded speakeasies each round of cocktails becomes a game of Russian roulette. Norris and Gettler triumph over seemingly unbeatable odds to become the pioneers of forensic chemistry and the gatekeepers of justice during a remarkably deadly time. A beguiling concoction that is equal parts true crime, twentieth-century history, and science thriller, The Poisoner's Handbook is a page-turning account of a forgotten New York.\" -From the publisher",

      "description": "This program is a partnership with The Faculty of Science at the University of Alberta. Celebrate Canadian mountains on the 120th anniversary of the Alpine Club of Canada, founded in March 1906. Historian PearlAnn Reichwein surveys mountain stories as your field guide. From early mountaineers in the Rockies and on glaciers in the Yukon St. Elias, artists at the Banff School of Fine Arts, to women on ski adventures in Banff and Jasper, her talk explores the history of the Canadian mountain west to understand people, places, and ideas. Featuring mountain landscapes and rare archival photographs, this account travels through time and reimagines mountain memory. Speakers: Dr PearlAnn Reichwein PearlAnn Reichwein, PhD, is a professor at the University of Alberta who studies mountain history and the Canadian west. Reichwein is the author of Climber's Paradise: Making Canada's Mountain Parks, 1906-1974, awarded the Canadian Historical Association Clio Prize and commended by INDIEFAB Book of the Year Awards. Her first book was Mountain Diaries: The Alpine Adventures of Margaret Fleming, 1929-1980, co-edited with Karen Fox. Both titles were shortlisted in the Banff Mountain Film and Book Festival. She co-authored Uplift: Visual Culture and the Banff School of Fine Arts with Karen Wall. Recently she collaborated with Graham McDowell and various co-authors of The Canadian Mountain Assessment: Walking Together to Enhance Understanding of Mountains in Canada, the Alberta Book Publishing Scholarly & Academic Book of the Year in 2024. Currently, Professor Reichwein writes about Canadian women in Nordic skiing and hosts the Ski Like a Girl Podcast – available on Spotify – with her research team in the Faculty of Kinesiology, Sport, and Recreation. Invited to guest lecture at the University of Gustave Eiffel in Paris and the University of Innsbruck in the Alps, Reichwein lives in Edmonton and enjoys giving public talks at museums and libraries. Let’s Show Some Love With Toques and Mittens! Our speaker and the Ski Like a Girl Podcast team are pleased to host a private toque and mitten drive in support of Spirit North. Please note that this is an independent initiative and is not connected to EPL. Spirit North is a national charitable organization that connects Indigenous youth to the land. Donations help reduce barriers and ensure warm winter outdoor play for young participants (ages 5–18). New toques and mittens (with a nylon or polyester cover—no knits or thin mitts) are welcome as optional donations at the door, but donations are not required for entry.

From the sublime (the faint sound of Mozart as you take your last breath) to the ridiculous (lessons on how to close the sagging jaw of a corpse), Tisdale leads us through the peaks and troughs of death with a calm, wise, and humorous hand. Advice for Future Corpses is more than a how-to manual or a spiritual bible: it is a graceful compilation of honest and intimate anecdotes based on the deaths Tisdale has witnessed in her work and life, as well as stories from cultures, traditions, and literature around the world. Free copies of the book are available while supplies last. The free copies will be distributed beginning Sunday, February 1, at 2 pm at the CV Reads Kick-Off Event. The book is also available in the Library collection. Advice for Future Corpses* An ASL (American Sign Language) interpreter or closed captioning can be provided for this program if requested at least seven (7) days in advance.

Pick up a copy at the library and come join us! Open to teens and adults. No registration required. As one of the few witches in Britain, Mika Moon knows she has to hide her magic, keep her head down, and stay away from other witches so their powers don’t mingle and draw attention. She’s used to being alone and she follows the rules...with one exception: an online account, where she posts videos \"pretending\" to be a witch. She thinks no one will take it seriously. But someone does. An unexpected message arrives, begging her to travel to the remote and mysterious Nowhere House to teach three young witches how to control their magic.The Fairfax Library SciFi and Fantasy Book Club will meet in-person every other month on a Tuesday evening to discuss a book within the genres of science fiction, fantasy, and/or horror. Everyone is welcome to attend whether or not you have read the selected book for that meeting. ADA Accommodation Request | Solicitud de Adaptación ADA",

This title should be on shelves and ready to borrow approximately 5 weeks prior to the discussion date. Check with a staff member if you have questions on how to access a copy.Book Description\"Beth and her gentle, kind husband Frank are happily married, but their relationship relies on the past staying buried. But when Beth’s brother-in-law shoots a dog going after their sheep, Beth doesn’t realize that the gunshot will alter the course of their lives. For the dog belonged to none other than Gabriel Wolfe, the man Beth loved as a teenager—the man who broke her heart years ago. Gabriel has returned to the village with his young son Leo, a boy who reminds Beth very much of her own son, who died in a tragic accident.As Beth is pulled back into Gabriel’s life, tensions around the village rise and dangerous secrets and jealousies from the past resurface, this time with deadly consequences. Beth is forced to make a choice between the woman she once was, and the woman she has become.A sweeping love story with the pace and twists of a thriller, Broken Country is a novel of simmering passion, impossible choices, and explosive consequences that toggles between the past and present to explore the far-reaching legacy of first love.\" --Provided by publisher.",

Since the fall of 2016, Saint Paul Public Library has been a Next Chapter Book Club affiliate. Next Chapter Book Club offers community-based book clubs for adolescents and adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Our members (including some who cannot read) love the way books transport them to different worlds where they meet interesting characters and learn about exciting new things. Taking that journey with a group of friends makes it even more delightful and fun. Join us online (click this link to connect to the virtual book club) Wednesdays 5-6 pm until we reach the end of the book. Estimated end date in March. Contact Erin at erin.zolotukhin-ridgway@ci.stpaul.mn.us with questions. This book will be shared online during book club.",

      "description": "Join us at Kobetich Branch to discuss a new book each month. This month we will be reading Rough Trade by Katrina Carrasco. Lambda Literary Award Winner, 2025 Finalist for the Edgar Award for Best Novel Named a Best Crime Novel of the Year byThe New York Times and a Best Book of the Year by The New Yorker and AutostraddleAlma Rosales is back and trouble is hot on her heels in this thrilling, queer historical novel from the critically acclaimed author of The Best Bad Things.Washington Territory, 1888. With contacts on the docks and in the railroad and a buyer’s market funneling product their way, ex-detective Alma Rosales and her opium-smuggling crew are making a fortune. They spend their days moving crates and their nights at the Monte Carlo, the center of Tacoma’s queer scene, where skirts and trousers don’t signify and everyone’s free to suit themselves. And Alma, who is living as a hardscrabble stevedore called Jack Camp, knows this most of all.When two local men end up dead, all signs point to the opium trade. A botched effort to disappear the bodies draws the attention of lawmen, and although Alma scrambles to keep them away from her operation, she’s distracted by the surprise appearance of Bess Spencer―an ex-Pinkerton agent and Alma’s first love―after years of silence. Then a handsome young stranger, Ben Velásquez, rolls into town and falls into an affair with one of Alma’s crewmen. When Ben starts asking questions about opium, Alma begins to suspect she has welcomed a spy into her inner circle, and she’s forced to consider how far she’ll go to protect her trade.Katrina Carrasco plunges readers into the vivid, rough-and-tumble world of the late-1800s Pacific Northwest in this genre and gender-blurring novel. Rough Trade follows Carrasco’s critically acclaimed debut, The Best Bad Things, and reimagines queer communities, the turbulent early days of modern media and medicine, and the pleasures―and price―of satisfying desire. The book is available for check out at the Kobetich circulation desk. The Kobetich Book Club meets on the last Wednesday of the month. New members are always welcome! Please call Kobetich library staff at 253-280-2921 for assistance with locating or reserving a copy.",

The man who went on to become the sixteenth president of the United States has assumed many roles in our historical consciousness, but most notable is that he was, with no apology, a politician. And as Steve Inskeep argues, it was because he was willing to engage in politics--to work with his critics, to compromise with those whom he deeply opposed, and to move only as fast as voters would allow--that he was able to lead a social revolution. In Differ We Must, Inskeep illuminates this master politician's life through sixteen encountersThe City of Evanston is committed to promoting a Citywide culture of accessibility and inclusivity.

Register today and join us online. March 2026 Selection: The Rook by Daniel O'Malley Book one of the urban fantasy / paranormal thriller series The Rook Files. \"The body you are wearing used to be mine.\" So begins the letter Myfanwy [rhymes with Tiffany] Thomas is holding when she awakes in a London park surrounded by bodies all wearing latex gloves. With no recollection of who she is, Myfanwy must follow the instructions her former self left behind to discover her identity and track down the agents who want to destroy her. She soon learns that she is a Rook, a high-ranking member of a secret organization called the Chequy [CHECK-eye] that battles the many supernatural forces at work in Britain. She also discovers that she possesses a rare, potentially deadly supernatural ability of her own. In her quest to uncover which member of the Chequy betrayed her and why, Myfanwy encounters a person with four bodies, an aristocratic woman who can enter her dreams, a secret training facility where children are transformed into deadly fighters, and a conspiracy more vast than she ever could have imagined. \"Adroitly straddles the thin line between fantasy, thriller, and spoof....O'Malley is a nimble writer, effortlessly leaping back and forth between comedy and action.\" — David Pitt, Booklist The Rook Speculative Fiction? What's that? Do you like science fiction? That's speculative fiction. Fantasy? OK, that's speculative fiction too.

We'll feature different titles and authors each month. Come and share your impressions, thoughts and interpretations of a book we have all read. This month we will be reading Cloud Cuckoo Land by Anthony Doerr. \"Constantinople, 1453: Anna lives in a convent where women toil all day embroidering the robes of priests. She learns the story of Aethon, who longs to be turned into a bird so that he can fly to the paradise of Cloud Cuckoo Land, a better world, and reads it to her sister as the walls of Constantinople are bombarded by armies of Saracens. Lakeport, Idaho, 2020: Seymour, an activist bent on saving the earth, sits in the public library with two homemade bombs in pressure cookers. Upstairs, eighty-five-year old Zeno, a former prisoner-of-war, and an amateur translator, rehearses five children in a play adaptation of Aethon's adventures. The future: On an interstellar ark called The Argos, Konstance, alone in a vault with access to all the information in the world, knows Aethon's story through her father, who has sequestered her to protect her. All are dreamers, misfits on the cusp of adulthood in a world the grown-ups have broken\"",

Skylark description:The second book in the series that began with the Newbery Medal–winning Sarah, Plain and Tall by Patricia MacLachlan. Sarah came to the prairie from Maine to marry Papa. But that summer, a drought turned the land dry and brown. Fires swept across the fields and coyotes came to the well in search of water. So Sarah took Anna and Caleb back east, where they would be safe. Papa stayed behind. He would not leave his land. Maine was beautiful, but Anna missed home, and Papa. And as the weeks went by, she began to wonder what would happen if the rains never came. Would she and Caleb and Sarah and Papa ever be a family again?",

This week we will be reading Ducks by Kate Beaton Katie heads out west to take advantage of Alberta's oil rush-part of the long tradition of East Coasters who seek gainful employment elsewhere when they can't find it in the homeland they love so much. Katie encounters the harsh reality of life in the oil sands, where trauma is an everyday occurrence yet is never discussed. Beaton's natural cartooning prowess is on full display as she draws colossal machinery and mammoth vehicles set against a sublime Albertan backdrop of wildlife, northern lights, and boreal forest. Her first full length graphic narrative, Ducks: Two Years in the Oil Sands is an untold story of Canada: a country that prides itself on its egalitarian ethos and natural beauty while simultaneously exploiting both the riches of its land and the humanity of its people.",

Whether you loved it, loathed it, or left it unfinished, we want to hear your take. Come share your impressions and connect with fellow readers! This month we will be discussing The Dutch House by Ann Patchett. At the end of the Second World War, Cyril Conroy combines luck and a single canny investment to begin an enormous real estate empire, propelling his family from poverty to enormous wealth. His first order of business is to buy a lavish estate in the suburbs outside of Philadelphia. Meant as a surprise for his wife, the house sets in motion the undoing of everyone he loves. The story is told by Cyril's son Danny, as he and his older sister, the brilliantly acerbic and self-assured Maeve, are exiled from the house where they grew up by their stepmother. The two wealthy siblings are thrown back into the poverty their parents had escaped from and find that all they have to count on is one another. It is this unshakeable bond between them that both saves their lives and thwarts their futures.",

      "library_slug": "sppl",
      "description": "Pulitzer Prize finalist Lee Hawkins is an acclaimed journalist, memoirist, and podcaster. Over nearly two decades with The Wall Street Journal, Hawkins honed his skill and voice as an investigative journalist, news editor, and on-camera reporter. He gained a following with The Business of Celebrity with Lee Hawkins, a recurring series with Hollywood superstars, sports icons, and business legends that explored the entrepreneurial and financial aspects of fame. Later in his career, Hawkins pivoted to coverage of race, equity, and education, with strong emphasis on the enduring impacts of slavery and Jim Crow segregation. These are subjects with deep personal resonance for him. Hawkins explores centuries of oppression and trauma in his own lineage in I Am Nobody’s Slave: How Uncovering My Family’s History Set Me Free. I Am Nobody’s Slave is a potent blend of memoir, history, social commentary, investigative reporting, and cutting-edge genealogical science. In a glowing review, Forbes summarizes: “Hawkins confronts the lingering effects of intergenerational trauma, showing that healing is an act of defiance in itself.” All events are FREE, open to the public, and registration is not required. You can find 180+ podcasts and videos from past seasons as well as author info and a calendar of events at clubbook.org.Hosted in partnership with Club Book, a program of the Metropolitan Library Service Agency (MELSA) and is coordinated by Library Strategies, the nonprofit consulting group of The Friends of the St. Paul Public Library. The program is made possible through Minnesota’s Arts & Cultural Heritage Fund. Club Book is a unique player on the Minnesota literary events scene. They collaborate with all eight library systems in the seven-county region to pair bestselling and award-winning authors with audiences in all corners of the Twin Cities metro.",

The Murderbot Diaries Vol 1 description:On a distant planet, a team of scientists are conducting surface tests, shadowed by their Company-supplied ‘droid ― a self-aware SecUnit that has hacked its own governor module, and refers to itself (though never out loud) as “Murderbot.” Scornful of humans, all it really wants is to be left alone long enough to figure out who it is (and to watch its favorite show in its downtime.) But when a neighboring mission goes dark, it’s up to the scientists and Murderbot to get to the truth.",

Pulitzer winner Fraser (Prairie Fires) makes a convincing case for arsenic and lead poisoning as contributing factors in this eyebrow-raising account. Fraser, who was born and raised in the Pacific Northwest, where smelters belted out poison for decades and a proliferation of serial killers in the 1970s and '80s earned the region the nickname \"America's Killing Fields,\" marries a poignant memoir of her Washington State childhood with a vivid catalog of crimes by Ted Bundy, the Green River Killer, and others. The eBook and eAudiobook are available on Libby. This month's location will be The Parkway Tavern MurderlandExplore all of Tacoma Public Library's Book Clubs.",

Promised freedom upon the death of their owner, she and her sister, Ruth, in a cruel twist of fate become the property of a malicious New York City couple, the Locktons, who have no sympathy for the American Revolution and even less for Ruth and Isabel. When Isabel meets Curzon, a slave with ties to the Patriots, he encourages her to spy on her owners, who know details of British plans for invasion. She is reluctant at first, but when the unthinkable happens to Ruth, Isabel realizes her loyalty belongs to whoever can provide her with freedom.",

Skylark description:The second book in the series that began with the Newbery Medal–winning Sarah, Plain and Tall by Patricia MacLachlan. Sarah came to the prairie from Maine to marry Papa. But that summer, a drought turned the land dry and brown. Fires swept across the fields and coyotes came to the well in search of water. So Sarah took Anna and Caleb back east, where they would be safe. Papa stayed behind. He would not leave his land. Maine was beautiful, but Anna missed home, and Papa. And as the weeks went by, she began to wonder what would happen if the rains never came. Would she and Caleb and Sarah and Papa ever be a family again?",

      "description": "Our book club meets monthly at the library to discuss books set in Oakland and the Bay Area or by Bay Area authors. We select our books from a variety of genres and eras so you’re sure to find something you’re interested in. We’ll get to learn more about our city, meet some neighbors and discuss what we’ve read. This year we’re mostly alternating fiction and non-fiction books. Meetings are the first Tuesday of the month (note the change from 2025!) from 6:30-7:30pm. Come to one discussion, a few or all of them! No pre-registration or commitment is required – all we ask is that you’ve read at least some of the book and are ready to discuss it. Here’s our 2026 schedule: (Quoted descriptions are from the library catalog unless otherwise noted.) January 6, 2026: Sourdough by Robin Sloan (fiction)We’re kicking off the year with a quick read about the very Bay Area intersection of tech and food culture. Lois is an exhausted software engineer who is gifted a very special sourdough starter by her favorite bakers when they must flee the country. Pretty soon she’s part of a mysterious underground food scene at the former Alameda Naval Air Station. February 3, 2026: Family Style: Memories of An American From Vietnam by Thien Pham (graphic memoir)The book that got the most votes from our members on our year-end poll! “Told through the lens of meaningful food and meals, this graphic novel chronicles the author’s childhood immigration to America, where food takes on new meaning as he and his family search for belonging, for happiness and for the American dream.” Pham is a graphic novelist, comic artist and educator based in Oakland. March 3, 2026: Deep Care: The Radical Activists Who Provided Abortions, Defied the Law, and Fought to Keep Clinics Open by Angela Hume (non-fiction)“The story of the radical feminist networks who worked outside the law to defend abortion. Deep Care follows generations of activists and clinicians who orbited the Women’s Choice clinic in Oakland from the early 1970s until 2010, as they worked underground and above ground, in small cells and broad coalitions and across political movements with grit, conviction, and allegiances of great trust to do what they believed needed to be done–despite the law, when required.” April 7, 2026: Moonglow by Michael Chabon (fiction)“A man bears witness to his grandfather’s deathbed confessions, which reveal his family’s long-buried history and his involvement in a mail-order novelty company, World War II and the space program.” Most of it isn’t set in Oakland, but it is the only book on this list that specifically mentions Montclair Library! May 5, 2026: Automatic Noodle by Annalee Newitz (science fiction)Our May read is a slim 163 pages, but packed with interesting ideas. This book is super popular as of December 2025, so you might want to get your hold in early. “In this semicozy tale set in a dystopian near future, robots open their own restaurant, build an unusual found family and achieve personal growth. A few years after the war that led to California’s secession from the United States, four robots awake in the flooded San Francisco takeout place where they were contracted to work.” (Kirkus) “Emboldened by newly granted civil rights from the California government, the bots reboot their lives in classic Bay Area form: by opening a noodle shop…In many ways, Newitz’s near-future San Francisco resembles today’s city, with not-so-subtle nods to AI anxieties, queer identity and the modern-day immigrant experience. It is, in the words of KQED’s Alexis Madrigal, ‘The most San Francisco book that has ever been or could ever have been written.’” (Leah Worthington) (Ebook listed separately) June 2, 2026: Moneyball by Michael Lewis (non-fiction)Baseball season is in full swing, which makes this the perfect time to read Michael Lewis’s nuanced exploration of “how Billy Beene, the general manager of the Oakland Athletics, used a new kind of thinking to build a successful and winning baseball team without spending enormous sums of money.” July 7, 2026: Girls Girls Girls by Shoshana von Blanckensee (fiction)In the summer of 1996, best friends (and secret girlfriends), Hannah and Sam drive from “New York, to the fabled queer paradise of San Francisco, free from the harsh gazes of their neighbors and the stifling demands of Hannah’s devout Orthodox Jewish mother. In San Francisco, they will finally be together as a real couple, out in the open, around other queer people.” But soon they’re working at a strip club, meeting new people and trying to figure out who just they are. August 4, 2026: Power Hungry: Women of the Black Panther Party and Freedom Summer and Their Fight to Feed a Movement by Suzanne Cope (non-fiction)Journey back with us to the summer of 1969 with the story of the free breakfast movement, grocery giveaways and other nurturing mutual aid programs started by the Black Panthers. “NYU writing professor Cope rescues two female activists from obscurity in this intriguing look at the role that food played in the civil rights and Black Power movements.” If you read One Crazy Summer with us in 2025, you’ll enjoy learning the backstory to the Panthers’ food program. September 1, 2026: Kasher in the Rye by Moshe Kasher (memoir)Go back to school with this “hilarious memoir about the absurdity of addiction.” “When he was a young boy, Kasher’s mother took him on a vacation to the West Coast. Well it was more like an abduction…They moved to Oakland, California. That’s where the real fun begins, in the war zone of Oakland Public Schools. Those early years read like part Augusten Burroughs, part David Sedaris, with a touch of Jim Carrol….Brutally honest and laugh-out-loud funny, Kasher…finds humor in even the most horrifying situations.” October 6, 2026: 107 Days by Kamala Harris (memoir)Hopefully by October the miles-long hold list for this book will have settled down enough for you to get a copy! “For the first time, and with surprising and revealing insights, Kamala Harris tells the story of one of the wildest and most consequential presidential campaigns in American history.” (NPR) November 3, 2026: The Giveaway: The Clay Blackburn Story by Owen Hill (crime fiction)We have something noir-ish by an Oakland author for those long November nights. “Hill’s crime fiction is whip-smart, stylish, subversive, hilarious and just dripping with East Bay color, culture and landmarks. Sweet and sour like a perfect Negroni, Hill has invented a new kind of East Bay Noir — the fog rolls in late, the golden afternoon glow somehow both luxurious and ominous in the class war that never sleeps.” (Recommendation from Tally Ho! Books via Oaklandside) December 1, 2026: Sign My Name to Freedom by Betty Reid Soskin (memoir)Reid Soskin, famous for being the oldest park ranger in the history of the National Park Service while working at the Rosie the Riveter National Park in Richmond, has been witness to a wide sweep of American history. She grew up in the Bay Area, raised four kids, ran a record store in Berkeley and more. “Betty just turned 104 and her memoir gives a fascinating look at African Americans migration, the Rosie the Riveter story, and beyond through the Civil Rights era.” (recommender) (Ebook and audiobook listed separately) « See our 2025 books here »« See our 2024 books here »« See our 2023 books here »Learn more about Montclair Library and its Friends group, FOML, here: About | Friends of Montclair Library",

      "description": "The Fairfax Library Thursday Morning Book Club will meet in-person every other month to discuss a new book. Everyone is welcome to attend whether or not you have read the selected book for that meeting. This is a drop-in event. We gather in person at the Fairfax Library for this conversation.We will be discussing our selection: On the Wings of a Cuckoo by Kokila Byrne.On the Wings of a Cuckoo is written by Fairfax's own Kokila Byrne. Join our discussion and gain insight from the author herself!\"In 1974, Kokila (Mary Ann Byrne) embarked on a life-changing journey, leaving her teaching career in the United States to travel to India with her five-year-old son. Over the next decade, they immersed themselves in a rich tapestry of diverse cultures, from the beaches of Goa in southern India to the majestic Himalayan mountains. After three transformative years, they joined the ashram of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, where Kokila welcomed the birth of her daughter. During their time in the East, Kokila and her family explored many countries. This extraordinary adventure shaped her worldview and deepened her connection to the human spirit. Returning to the United States in 1984, Kokila resumed her teaching career, yet her wanderlust and quest for understanding remained undiminished. Each summer, she embarked on new journeys to distant lands, continually weaving her life with rich experiences and a global perspective. Kokila's writing reflects profound insights gained from years of exploration, spiritual growth, and cross-cultural encounters. Her work invites readers to join her on a journey of discovery-both outward into the world and inward to the depths of the soul.\"--AmazonTo acquire a copy of this book, please call Fairfax Library at 415-453-8151.Fairfax Book Club is sponsored by the Friends of the Fairfax Library.

We will introduce Volume 1 of a series to get you started on your next reading adventure. We encourage teens to read at least Volume 1, whether that is a physical copy from your own manga collection, from our library, or borrowed from a friend. Digital reading also counts; we will be happy to have you participate in our discussion if you have read an e-copy. Physical copies of Volume 1 will be available for in person pick-up at the Enon Branch on a first come, first served basis. Check out Libby and Hoopla for available digital copies. Scheduled for the second Monday of the month. For teens. This month's selection: Witch Hat Atelier by Kamome Shirahama Summary: In a world where everyone takes wonders like magic spells and dragons for granted, Coco is a girl with a simple dream: She wants to be a witch. But everybody knows magicians are born, not made, and Coco was not born with a gift for magic. Resigned to her un-magical life, Coco is about to give up on her dream to become a witch...until the day she meets Qifrey, a mysterious, traveling magician. After secretly seeing Qifrey perform magic in a way she's never seen before, Coco soon learns what everybody \"knows\" might not be the truth, and discovers that her magical dream may not be as far away as it may seem...” Rated 13 +",

Within the labyrinth of halls an ocean is imprisoned; waves thunder up staircases; rooms are flooded in an instant. But Piranesi is not afraid; he understands the tides as he understands the pattern of the labyrinth itself. He lives to explore the house.But as Piranesi explores, evidence emerges of another person, and a terrible truth begins to unravel, revealing a world beyond the one Piranesi has always known.Copies of Piranesi are available at Main while they last for sign out, or from various branch collections.",

Promised freedom upon the death of their owner, she and her sister, Ruth, in a cruel twist of fate become the property of a malicious New York City couple, the Locktons, who have no sympathy for the American Revolution and even less for Ruth and Isabel. When Isabel meets Curzon, a slave with ties to the Patriots, he encourages her to spy on her owners, who know details of British plans for invasion. She is reluctant at first, but when the unthinkable happens to Ruth, Isabel realizes her loyalty belongs to whoever can provide her with freedom.",

This title should be on shelves and ready to borrow approximately 5 weeks prior to the discussion date. Check with a staff member if you have questions on how to access a copy.Book Description\"In a near-future Kolkata beset by flooding and blight, Ma, her two year old daughter Mishti, and her elderly father Dadu are just days from leaving the collapsing city behind to join Ma's husband in the home he has been building for them in Ann Arbor, Michigan. After procuring long-awaited passports and visas from the consulate, they pack their bags for the flight to America. But in the morning they awaken to discover that Ma's purse, with all the treasured documents within it, has been stolen. A Guardian and a Thief tells two stories: the story of Ma and her family, their struggle to emigrate to America, and their devastation in the wake of the theft that changes their fate to one of implacable tragedy; and Boomba, the thief, whose hunger and desperation to care for his family drive him to commit a crime whose consequences he cannot fathom. With stunning control and command, Megha Majumdar paints a kaleidoscopic portrait of two families whose destinies become inexorably entangled, wresting compassion from each narrative as the complexities of each character's circumstances-their helplessness in the face of poverty and corruption, and the need to stave off encroaching catastrophe--are captured with clarity and piercing empathy. A masterful new work from one of the most exciting voices of her generation\"--Provided by publisher.",

This title should be on shelves and ready to borrow approximately 5 weeks prior to the discussion date. Check with a staff member if you have questions on how to access a copy.Book Description\"A dazzling debut that asks: Can a name shape the course of a life? In the wake of an enormous, history-making storm, Cora sets off with her nine-year-old daughter, Maia, to register her son's birth. Her husband Gordon, a local doctor, respected in the community but a terrifying and controlling presence at home, intends for her to follow his family tradition going back generations, and name the child Gordon. But on the journey there, Cora wonders if it's right to impose the burden of this name and its legacy onto her tiny newborn son. She herself has Julian in mind, and Maia offers up her own suggestion: Bear. What follows are three alternate and alternating versions of both Cora's life and her young son's life shaped by her brave, last-minute choice of name. Spanning thirty-five years, the novel draws us in from the first page, as we follow three unforgettable journeys of one young man, but also his mother, grandmother, and sister. In richly layered prose, The Names explores the painful ripple effects of domestic abuse, the messy ties of family, and the possibilities of autonomy and healing.\"--Provided by publisher.",

The Murderbot Diaries Vol 1 description:On a distant planet, a team of scientists are conducting surface tests, shadowed by their Company-supplied ‘droid ― a self-aware SecUnit that has hacked its own governor module, and refers to itself (though never out loud) as “Murderbot.” Scornful of humans, all it really wants is to be left alone long enough to figure out who it is (and to watch its favorite show in its downtime.) But when a neighboring mission goes dark, it’s up to the scientists and Murderbot to get to the truth.",

Among them are a Wall Street wunderkind, a young woman coming to terms with an unexpected pregnancy, an injured veteran returning from Afghanistan, a business tycoon, and a free-spirited woman running away from her controlling husband. Halfway across the country, the plane crashes. Edward is the sole survivor.Edward’s story captures the attention of the nation, but he struggles to find a place in a world without his family. He continues to feel that a part of himself has been left in the sky, forever tied to the plane and all of his fellow passengers. But then he makes an unexpected discovery—one that will lead him to the answers of some of life’s most profound questions: When you’ve lost everything, how do you find the strength to put one foot in front of the other? How do you learn to feel safe again? How do you find meaning in your life?",

      "description": "Join us for the Swasey Book Club! April's selection is The Frozen River by Ariel Lawhon. About the book:\"A gripping historical mystery based on the real-life diary entries of Martha Ballard, an 18th-century midwife who defied the legal system and wrote herself into American history. Maine, 1789: When the Kennebec River freezes, entombing a man in the ice, Martha Ballard is summoned to examine the body and determine cause of death. As a midwife and healer, she is privy to much of what goes on behind closed doors in Hallowell. Her diary is a record of every birth and death, crime and debacle that unfolds in the close-knit community. When a local physician undermines her conclusion, declaring the death to be an accident, Martha is forced to investigate the shocking murder on her own. Over the course of one winter, as the trial nears, and whispers and prejudices mount, Martha doggedly pursues the truth. Her diary soon lands at the center of the scandal, implicating those she loves, and compelling Martha to decide where her own loyalties lie.\" Stop into the Swasey branch to secure your book club copy and then join us for the discussion on April 21. We hope you'll join us! The Swasey Book Club selection checks out on a first-come, first-served basis. Supply is limited. Ask library staff for assistance. Call us at (253)280-2970 if you have any questions.",

Delicate, yet exceedingly raw, these poems will transport you as vividly as any work of fiction. If I could fly backward, I would. To the safety of branches, to the time when my heart still raced for you, twelve hundred beats a minute. In poetry that is at once bold and lyrical, affecting and devastatingly frank, Miranda Cowley Heller takes us through childhood, marriage, motherhood, and beyond. Suffused with the natural world and the landscape of Cape Cod, where many of the poems are set, What the Deep Water Knows contemplates love in all the seasons. Register now to celebrate National Poetry Month with this graceful new poetry collection. About the Author: Miranda Cowley Heller was raised in New York City and Cape Cod. Her debut novel The Paper Palace was a number one New York Times bestseller in the US, a Sunday Times bestseller in the UK, and was longlisted for the Women’s Prize. She has worked as a senior vice president and head of drama series at HBO, developing and overseeing such shows as The Sopranos, Six Feet Under, The Wire, Deadwood, and Big Love, among others. This is her first poetry collection.",

Participants will be notified by email. Books will also be available to borrow at the library. The Dayton’s Bluff Book Club is a collaboration of the Metropolitan State University Library and the Dayton’s Bluff Branch of Saint Paul Public Library whose members live, work or attend classes on the East Side. We prioritize our selection of titles to those written by Minnesota authors, that have a local setting, or that are written by people of color and other diverse authors. Book discussions usually include issues related to social justice, equity, and anti-racism. We encourage book club members to use both the university and public libraries in pursuit of lifelong learning and the joy of reading. Discussions are frequently facilitated by authors, Metropolitan State faculty, or other guests from the community.

To contain secrets, American and Soviet leaders created plutopias--communities of nuclear families living in highly-subsidized, limited-access atomic cities. Brown shows that the plants' segregation of permanent and temporary workers and of nuclear and non-nuclear zones created a bubble of immunity, where dumps and accidents were glossed over and plant managers freely embezzled and polluted. In four decades, the Hanford plant near Richland and the Maiak plant near Ozersk each issued at least 200 million curies of radioactive isotopes into the surrounding environment--equaling four Chernobyls--laying waste to hundreds of square miles and contaminating rivers, fields, forests, and food supplies. This month's location will be at E9 Firehouse and Gastropub Plutopia Explore all of Tacoma Public Library's Book Clubs.",

We meet from 4-5pm. #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • NOW A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE A mission to Mars. A freak accident. One man’s struggle to survive. From the author of Project Hail Mary comes “a hugely entertaining novel that reads like a rocket ship afire” (Chicago Tribune). “Brilliant . . . a celebration of human ingenuity [and] the purest example of real-science sci-fi for many years . . . utterly compelling.”—The Wall Street Journal Six days ago, astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first people to walk on Mars. Now, he’s sure he’ll be the first person to die there. After a dust storm nearly kills him and forces his crew to evacuate while thinking him dead, Mark finds himself stranded and completely alone with no way to even signal Earth that he’s alive—and even if he could get word out, his supplies would be gone long before a rescue could arrive. Chances are, though, he won’t have time to starve to death. The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment, or plain-old “human error” are much more likely to kill him first. But Mark isn’t ready to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering skills—and a relentless, dogged refusal to quit—he steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next. Will his resourcefulness be enough to overcome the impossible odds against him? NAMED ONE OF PASTE’S BEST NOVELS OF THE DECADE “As gripping as they come . . . You’ll be rooting for Watney the whole way, groaning at every setback and laughing at his pitchblack humor. Utterly nail-biting and memorable.”—Financial Times The book is available for check out at the Kobetich circulation desk. The Kobetich Book Club meets on the last Wednesday of the month. New members are always welcome! Please call Kobetich library staff at 253-280-2921 for assistance with locating or reserving a copy.",

Register today and join us online.April 2026 Selection:Ocean's Godori by Elaine U. ChoExciting, fresh and unique perspective science fiction from a rising Seattle writer.Ocean Yoon has never felt very Korean, even if she is descended from a long line of haenyeo, Jeju Island's beloved female divers. She doesn't like soju, constantly misses cultural references, and despite her love of the game, people still say that she doesn't play Hwatu like a Korean. Ocean's also persona non grata at the Alliance, Korea's solar system-dominating space agency, since a mission went awry and she earned a reputation for being a little too quick with her gun. When her best friend, Teo, second son of the Anand Tech empire, is framed for murdering his family, Ocean and her misfit crewmates are pushed to the forefront of a high-stakes ideological conflict. But dodging bullets and winning space chases may be the easiest part of what comes next.“Ocean’s Godori navigates the space lane blazed by Becky Chambers and James S.A. Corey, but it manages to arrive at some exciting new destinations.” — Charlie Jane Anders, Washington PostOcean's Godori Speculative Fiction? What's that? Do you like science fiction? That's speculative fiction. Fantasy? OK, that's speculative fiction too. Horror, magical realism, alternate history, slipstream, steampunk, cyberpunk, dystopias, apocalyptic tales, and stories that are just plain weird? Yep.

      "description": "Join us online for an evening with author, Daniel H. Wilson.Wilson is a frequent New York Times bestseller with a long bibliography that spans speculative fiction, techno-thrillers, and science satire. His work is informed by his education and research background, including a Ph.D. in Robotics from Carnegie Mellon University. Early standouts include How to Survive a Robot Uprising (2005) and How to Build a Robot Army (2007), humorous but fact-based guides about the dangers of robotics and Al. Wilson may be best known to many for his documentary-style doomsday novel Robopocalypse (2011) and its sequel Robogenesis (2014). Subsequent work includes The Clockwork Dynasty (2017), an historical fantasy about a secret, immortal race of biological automatons whose existence has quietly shaped human history, and The Andromeda Evolution (2019), an authorized sequel to the Michael Crichton classic The Andromeda Strain. Wilson's latest novel, Hole in the Sky, is an alien encounter story inspired by the author's own Cherokee background. Notes The Seattle Times: \"Wilson reimagines first contact through an Indigenous lens, fusing Cherokee cosmology with cutting-edge science and creeping cosmic horror.\" This event is free. Visit facebook.com/ClubBook for more info and to join the discussion on May 4.",

      "description": "Everyone is welcome to join our online (Zoom) book discussion group on Wednesday May 13, 2026. For more information and a Zoom invite, contact Davo Knepler at nuevodavos@yahoo.com.We will be discussing California Dreaming by Noa Silber. Having grown up on stories of her mother's wild youth in California, Elena Berg relocates from New England to the Bay Area in 2011 for a placement as an English teacher with Teach for America. Once there, she is eager to inspire a love of poetry and literature in her diverse but underprivileged students. Her own grandfather--a Holocaust survivor--was a storyteller and teacher who touched the lives of his students for years to come. Elena's mother followed in his footsteps, leaving behind the hippie lifestyle of her twenties to become a university professor. But Elena quickly finds herself feeling disconnected from teaching, unable to inspire her students, and before long, she grows disillusioned with her career. She transitions to a role in an education technology startup--though she questions her decision, her motivations, and her values. Coming of age between the Occupy and #MeToo movements and against the backdrop of the 2016 election and California's ever-worsening fire season, Elena reckons with California as she imagined it and California as it really is. As she does so, she must also ultimately reconcile the person she envisioned herself to be with the person she actually is. For more information and a Zoom invite, contact Davo Knepler at nuevodavos@yahoo.com. Everyone is welcome to attend.

With her husband frequently deployed, Simone is left to find her place in this new world, alone—until she meets the wives.Gorrindo gives us an intimate look into the inner lives of a remarkable group of women and a tender, unflinching portrait of a marriage. A love story, an unforgettable coming-of-age tale, and a bracing tour of the intractable divisions that plague our country today, The Wives offers a rare and powerful gift: a hopeful stitch in the fabric of a torn America.",

      "description": "Join us for the Swasey Book Club! May's selection is The Serviceberry by Robin Wall Kimmerer. About the book:In Braiding Sweetgrass, Robin Wall Kimmerer reflects on the practice of harvesting serviceberries and the concept of reciprocity central to Indigenous wisdom. She contrasts this with the dominant economic system rooted in scarcity, competition, and resource hoarding. Kimmerer highlights how the serviceberry tree, by sharing its abundance with its ecosystem, embodies a model of interdependence and mutual support. This ethic of reciprocity, she argues, shows us that true wealth arises from relationships, not self-sufficiency, and encourages us to reimagine our values in a way that nurtures both people and the planet. Stop into the Swasey branch to secure your book club copy and then join us for the discussion on May 19. We hope you'll join us! The Swasey Book Club selection checks out on a first-come, first-served basis. Supply is limited. Ask library staff for assistance. Call us at (253)280-2970 if you have any questions.",

      "description": "Join us at Books on Tap to discuss They Called Us Enemy, by George Takei.Takei has spoken publicly about his childhood experiences in internment camps during WWII, and this graphic memoir tells that story again with a compelling blend of nostalgia and outrage. He was very young when he and his family were forced out of their California home and sent to Camp Rohwer in Arkansas, so some of his memories of that time are touched with gentle affection, though that fondness is short-lived. As he grows older and they're relocated to a camp with harsher conditions, it seems less like an adventure and more like the atrocity it truly is. Takei, together with Justin Eisinger and Steven Scott, interweaves scenes of his adult realizations and reflections, as well as key speeches and historical events of the period, among the accounts of his childhood, which is very effective at providing context for those memories.The eBook is available on Libby and Comics Plus. This month's location will be at the Parkway TavernThey Called Us EnemyExplore all of Tacoma Public Library's Book Clubs.",

      "description": "Join us at Kobetich Branch to discuss a new book each month. This month we will be reading They Called Us Enemy by George Takei. We meet from 4-5 pm. Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards Winner, 2020 New York Times Bestseller! Discover this award-winning masterpiece before the release of George Takei's deeply personal follow-up, It Rhymes With Takei (June 2025). A stunning graphic memoir recounting actor/author/activist George Takei's childhood imprisoned within American concentration camps during World War II. Experience the forces that shaped an American icon -- and America itself -- in this gripping tale of courage, country, loyalty, and love George Takei has captured hearts and minds worldwide with his captivating stage presence and outspoken commitment to equal rights. But long before he braved new frontiers in Star Trek, he woke up as a four-year-old boy to find his own birth country at war with his father's -- and their entire family forced from their home into an uncertain future In 1942, at the order of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, every person of Japanese descent on the west coast was rounded up and shipped to one of ten \"relocation centers,\" hundreds or thousands of miles from home, where they would be held for years under armed guard. They Called Us Enemy is Takei's firsthand account of those years behind barbed wire, the joys and terrors of growing up under legalized racism, his mother's hard choices, his father's faith in democracy, and the way those experiences planted the seeds for his astonishing future. What does it mean to be American? Who gets to decide? When the world is against you, what can one person do? To answer these questions, George Takei joins co-writers Justin Eisinger & Steven Scott and artist Harmony Becker for the journey of a lifetime. The book is available for check out at the Kobetich circulation desk. The Kobetich Book Club meets on the last Wednesday of the month. New members are always welcome! Please call Kobetich library staff at 253-280-2921 for assistance with locating or reserving a copy.They Called Us Enemy",

      "description": "The Fairfax Library Thursday Morning Book Club will meet in-person every other month to discuss a new book. Everyone is welcome to attend whether or not you have read the selected book for that meeting. This is a drop-in event. We gather in person at the Fairfax Library for this conversation.We will be discussing our selection: The Forest of Enchantments by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni The Ramayana, one of the world's greatest epics, is also a tragic love story. In this brilliant retelling, Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni places Sita at the centre of the novel: this is Sita's version. The Forest of Enchantments is also a very human story of some of the other women in the epic, often misunderstood and relegated to the margins: Kaikeyi, Surpanakha, Mandodari. A powerful comment on duty, betrayal, infidelity and honour, it is also about women's struggle to retain autonomy in a world that privileges men, as Chitra transforms an ancient story into a gripping, contemporary battle of wills. While the Ramayana resonates even today, she makes it more relevant than ever, in the underlying questions in the novel: How should women be treated by their loved ones? What are their rights in a relationship? When does a woman need to stand up and say, Enough! Available Format: Print BookFairfax Book Club is sponsored by the Friends of the Fairfax Library.

      "description": "Pick up the next book club selection at the Manchester library service desk following the previous month's meeting on the 3rd Monday of the month. **NOTE Meetings in January and February each year are held on the FOURTH Monday of the month due to the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day and President's Day holidays This month we are discussing:The Familiar by Leigh BardugoFrom the Publisher:In a shabby house, on a shabby street, in the new capital of Madrid, Luzia Cotado uses scraps of magic to get through her days of endless toil as a scullion. But when her scheming mistress discovers the lump of a servant cowering in the kitchen is actually hiding a talent for little miracles, she demands Luzia use those gifts to improve the family's social position.What begins as simple amusement for the nobility takes a perilous turn when Luzia garners the notice of Antonio Pérez, the disgraced secretary to Spain's king. Still reeling from the defeat of his armada, the king is desperate for any advantage in the war against England's heretic queen—and Pérez will stop at nothing to regain the king's favor.Determined to seize this one chance to better her fortunes, Luzia plunges into a world of seers and alchemists, holy men and hucksters, where the lines between magic, science, and fraud are never certain. But as her notoriety grows, so does the danger that her Jewish blood will doom her to the Inquisition's wrath. She will have to use every bit of her wit and will to survive—even if that means enlisting the help of Guillén Santángel, an embittered immortal familiar whose own secrets could prove deadly for them both.",

For more information and a Zoom invite, contact Davo Knepler at nuevodavos@yahoo.com.We will be discussing The Fixer by Bernard Malamud. The Fixer is the winner of the 1967 National Book Award for Fiction and the 1967 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. It is Bernard Malamud's best-known and most acclaimed novel -- one that makes manifest his roots in Russian fiction, especially that of Isaac Babel.Set in Kiev in 1911 during a period of heightened anti-Semitism, the novel tells the story of Yakov Bok, a Jewish handyman blamed for the brutal murder of a young Russian boy. Bok leaves his village to try his luck in Kiev, and after denying his Jewish identity, finds himself working for a member of the anti-Semitic Black Hundreds Society. When the boy is found nearly drained of blood in a cave, the Black Hundreds accuse the Jews of ritual murder. Arrested and imprisoned, Bok refuses to confess to a crime that he did not commit.For more information and a Zoom invite, contact Davo Knepler at nuevodavos@yahoo.com. Everyone is welcome to attend.

Please see a staff member for details on borrowing the title. Book Description: In a placid, progressive suburb of Cleveland, everything is planned - from the layout of the winding roads, to the colors of the houses, to the successful lives its residents will go on to lead. And no one embodies this spirit more than Elena Richardson, whose guiding principle is playing by the rules. Enter Mia Warren - an enigmatic artist and single mother - who arrives in this idyllic bubble with her teenaged daughter Pearl, and rents a house from the Richardsons. Soon Mia and Pearl become more than tenants: all four Richardson children are drawn to the mother-daughter pair. But Mia carries with her a mysterious past and a disregard for the status quo that threatens to upend this carefully ordered community. When old family friends of the Richardsons attempt to adopt a Chinese-American baby, a custody battle erupts that dramatically divides the town--and puts Mia and Elena on opposing sides. Suspicious of Mia and her motives, Elena is determined to uncover the secrets in Mia's past. But her obsession will come at unexpected and devastating costs.",

Tricia is a shy newlywed, married to a rising attorney on loan to navy intelligence. Charlene is a practiced corporate spouse and mother of three, a beauty and a bully. In Saigon in 1963, the two women form a wary alliance as they balance the era’s mandate to be “helpmeets” to their ambitious husbands with their own inchoate impulse to “do good” for the people of Vietnam.Sixty years later, Charlene’s daughter, spurred by an encounter with an aging Vietnam vet, reaches out to Tricia. Together, they look back at their time in Saigon, taking wry account of that pivotal year and of Charlene’s altruistic machinations, and discovering how their own lives as women on the periphery—of politics, of history, of war, of their husbands’ convictions—have been shaped and burdened by the same sort of unintended consequences that followed America’s tragic interference in Southeast Asia.A virtuosic new novel from Alice McDermott, one of our most observant, most affecting writers, about folly and grace, obligation, sacrifice, and, finally, the quest for absolution in a broken world.",

      "description": "Join us to celebrate the love of reading with others in our community! The Lynnwood Library Book Group meets regularly on the second Monday of each month from 6:30-7:45pm. This month's selection is How to Age Disgracefully by Clare Pooley. Books are selected by members of the group and cover a variety of genres. When Lydia takes a job running the Senior Citizens' Social Club three afternoons a week, she assumes she'll be spending her time drinking tea and playing gentle games of cards. The members of the Social Club, however, are not at all what Lydia was expecting. From Art, a failed actor turned kleptomaniac to Daphne, who has been hiding from her dark past for decades to Ruby, a Banksy-style knitter who gets revenge in yarn, these seniors look deceptively benign--but when age makes you invisible, secrets are so much easier to hide. When the city council threatens to sell the doomed community center building, the members of the Social Club join forces with their tiny friends in the daycare next door--as well as the teenaged father of one of the toddlers and a geriatric dog--to save the building. Together, this group's unorthodox methods may actually work, as long as the police don't catch up with them first.View all of Lynnwood Library Book Group's 2026 selections.Contact us with questions Programs & Events FAQs To request a sign language interpreter, complete this online form or contact your local library at least two weeks prior to the library event.

      "description": "The Fairfax Library Thursday Morning Book Club will meet in-person every other month to discuss a new book. Everyone is welcome to attend whether or not you have read the selected book for that meeting. This is a drop-in event. We gather in person at the Fairfax Library for this conversation.We will be discussing our selection: Moloka'i by Alan Brennert Young Rachel Kalama, growing up in idyllic Honolulu in the 1890s, is part of a big, loving Hawaiian family, and dreams of seeing the far-off lands that her father, a merchant seaman, often visits. But at the age of seven, Rachel and her dreams are shattered by the discovery that she has leprosy. Forcibly removed from her family, she is sent to Kalaupapa, the isolated leper colony on the island of Moloka'i.In her exile she finds a family of friends to replace the family she's lost: a native healer, Haleola, who becomes her adopted \"auntie\" and makes Rachel aware of the rich culture and mythology of her people; Sister Mary Catherine Voorhies, one of the Franciscan sisters who care for young girls at Kalaupapa; and the beautiful, worldly Leilani, who harbors a surprising secret. At Kalaupapa she also meets the man she will one day marry.True to historical accounts, Moloka'i is the story of an extraordinary human drama, the full scope and pathos of which has never been told before in fiction. But Rachel's life, though shadowed by disease, isolation, and tragedy, is also one of joy, courage, and dignity. This is a story about life, not death; hope, not despair. It is not about the failings of flesh, but the strength of the human spirit. Available Formats: Print Book, Audiobook DownloadFairfax Book Club is sponsored by the Friends of the Fairfax Library.

Why do we believe that success means constant hustle, that more is always better, or that everyone must go it alone? What other ways of thinking might help us make sense of everyday life? Together, we’ll read accessible texts from different philosophical traditions and enjoy open, respectful conversations about the assumptions shaping our world. Open to adults and young adults. No background in philosophy required—just curiosity and a willingness to talk and listen. We’ll read the following books: Living for Pleasure: An Epicurean Guide to Life by Emily A. Austin A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy by William B. Irvine Choosing Freedom: A Kantian Guide to Life by Karen Stohr On Being and Becoming: an Existentialist Approach to Life by Jennifer Anna Gosetti-Ferencei Blooming in the Ruins: How Mexican Philosophy Can Guide Us Toward the Good Life by Carlos Alberto Sánchez We’ll meet every first and third Sunday at the Rinconada Library from 3:30 PM to 4:45 PM.

So when Agatha Paul, a writer and visiting professor itching for her next big topic, offers Millie an easy yet unusual opportunity for them to help each other further their own interests, Millie naturally jumps at the chance.But Millie’s starry-eyed hustle quickly becomes jeopardized by a lonely transfer student, unruly residents, and illicit intrigue.

      "description": "Want to connect with others over the love of reading? Join our book club to discuss Anthony Doerr's All the Light We Cannot See. Please see a staff member for details on borrowing the title. Book Description:\"From the highly acclaimed, multiple award-winning Anthony Doerr, a stunningly ambitious and beautiful novel about a blind French girl and a German boy whose paths collide in occupied France as both try to survive the devastation of World War II. Marie Laure lives with her father in Paris within walking distance of the Museum of Natural History where he works as the master of the locks (there are thousands of locks in the museum). When she is six, she goes blind, and her father builds her a model of their neighborhood, every house, every manhole, so she can memorize it with her fingers and navigate the real streets with her feet and cane. When the Germans occupy Paris, father and daughter flee to Saint-Malo on the Brittany coast, where Marie-Laure's agoraphobic great uncle lives in a tall, narrow house by the sea wall. In another world in Germany, an orphan boy, Werner, grows up with his younger sister, Jutta, both enchanted by a crude radio Werner finds. He becomes a master at building and fixing radios, a talent that wins him a place at an elite and brutal military academy and, ultimately, makes him a highly specialized tracker of the Resistance. Werner travels through the heart of Hitler Youth to the far-flung outskirts of Russia, and finally into Saint-Malo, where his path converges with Marie-Laure. Doerr's gorgeous combination of soaring imagination with observation is electric. Deftly interweaving the lives of Marie-Laure and Werner, Doerr illuminates the ways, against all odds, people try to be good to one another. Ten years in the writing, All the light we cannot see is his most ambitious and dazzling work\"--Provided by publisher.",

Why do we believe that success means constant hustle, that more is always better, or that everyone must go it alone? What other ways of thinking might help us make sense of everyday life? Together, we’ll read accessible texts from different philosophical traditions and enjoy open, respectful conversations about the assumptions shaping our world. Open to adults and young adults. No background in philosophy required—just curiosity and a willingness to talk and listen. We’ll read the following books: Living for Pleasure: An Epicurean Guide to Life by Emily A. Austin A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy by William B. Irvine Choosing Freedom: A Kantian Guide to Life by Karen Stohr On Being and Becoming: an Existentialist Approach to Life by Jennifer Anna Gosetti-Ferencei Blooming in the Ruins: How Mexican Philosophy Can Guide Us Toward the Good Life by Carlos Alberto Sánchez We’ll meet every first and third Sunday at the Rinconada Library from 3:30 PM to 4:45 PM.

For more information and a Zoom invite, contact Davo Knepler at nuevodavos@yahoo.com.We will be discussing The Safekeep by Yael van der Wouden.It is 1961 and the rural Dutch province of Overijssel is quiet. Bomb craters have been filled, buildings reconstructed, and the war is truly over. Living alone in her late mother's country home, Isabel knows her life is as it should be--led by routine and discipline. But all is upended when her brother Louis brings his graceless new girlfriend Eva, leaving her at Isabel's doorstep as a guest, to stay for the season. Eva is Isabel's antithesis: she sleeps late, walks loudly through the house, and touches things she shouldn't. In response, Isabel develops a fury-fueled obsession, and when things start disappearing around the house--a spoon, a knife, a bowl--Isabel's suspicions begin to spiral. In the sweltering peak of summer, Isabel's paranoia gives way to infatuation--leading to a discovery that unravels all Isabel has ever known. The war might not be well and truly over after all, and neither Eva--nor the house in which they live--are what they seem. For more information and a Zoom invite, contact Davo Knepler at nuevodavos@yahoo.com. Everyone is welcome to attend.

This title should be on shelves and ready to borrow approximately 5 weeks prior to the discussion date. Check with a staff member if you have questions on how to access a copy.Book Description: \"A cross-cultural love story set against the dramatic backdrop of the Allied invasion of Europe in WWII. Vancouver, 1942. Josiah Chang arrives in the bustling city ready to serve his country in the war against fascism, but Chinese Canadians are barred from joining the army out of fear they might expect citizenship in return. So, Josiah heads to the shipyard to find work as a riveter, fastening together the ribs and steel plates of Victory ships. One night, Josiah spots Poppy singing at a navy club. Despite their different backgrounds, they fall for each other instantly and begin a starry-eyed romance that lasts until the harsh reality of their situation is made clear. Determined to prove himself, Josiah takes a train to Toronto where he’s finally given the chance to enlist. After volunteering for the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion and jumping into Normandy on D-Day, he must fight through the battlefields of Europe to make it back to the woman he loves. By turns harrowing and exhilarating, The Riveter explores what one man must sacrifice to belong to the only country he has ever called home.\" -- Provided by Publisher",

      "description": "Want to connect with others over the love of reading? Join our book club to discuss Robert Macfarlane's Is a River Alive? This title should be on shelves and ready to borrow approximately 5 weeks prior to the discussion date. Check with a staff member if you have questions on how to access a copy.Book Description\"From the celebrated nature writer, observer and advocate Robert Macfarlane, a brilliant, immersive and paradigm-shifting book that says an emphatic yes to the question it asks. Robert Macfarlane writes, \"At the heart of Is A River Alive? is a single, powerful idea: that rivers, forests, glaciers and mountains are living beings, and that as such they have rights that should be recognized both in imagination and in law. The river has the right to flow unimpeded to the sea; the old-growth forest the right not to be felled; the mountain the right not to be disembowelled for coal.\" This idea -- known as the Rights of Nature -- is driving a conceptual and legal revolution, largely led by Indigenous and non-white activists who are succeeding at challenging the Western legal system to think beyond the idea of nature as material for humans to exploit to a future where regarding all of nature as a living entity may ensure our survival. The book flows like water, from the mountains to the sea, following three major journeys Macfarlane undertakes with local activists: to Ecuador where a recent court decision protects the ancient cedars of the cloud forests from Canadian mining activity; to India, where the fight to revive rivers that start in the glaciers of the Himalayas and empty into the ocean and polluted lagoons of Chennai is not yet won; and to northeastern Quebec where in 2021 an alliance between the local Innu nation and the regional municipal council declared the Mutehekau (Magpie) River a living being, with legal rights. Along with the voices of his fellow travellers, Macfarlane's own voice and incomparable gifts of expression carry immeasurable power to open hearts, spark conversations and challenge perspectives, making Is A River Alive? not only a wondrous literary experience but a powerful rallying cry in the environmental justice movement\"--Provided by publisher.",

Together, we’ll read accessible texts from different philosophical traditions and enjoy open, respectful conversations about the assumptions shaping our world. Open to adults and young adults. No background in philosophy required—just curiosity and a willingness to talk and listen. We’ll read the following books: Living for Pleasure: An Epicurean Guide to Life by Emily A.

Irvine Choosing Freedom: A Kantian Guide to Life by Karen Stohr On Being and Becoming: an Existentialist Approach to Life by Jennifer Anna Gosetti-Ferencei Blooming in the Ruins: How Mexican Philosophy Can Guide Us Toward the Good Life by Carlos Alberto Sánchez We’ll meet every first and third Sunday at the Rinconada Library from 3:30 PM to 4:45 PM.

But Kate is also guarding a tremendous, life-defining secret—one that’s become so unbearable that it begins to unravel her newly established expat life. She suspects that another American couple are not who they claim to be; her husband is acting suspiciously; and as she travels around Europe, she finds herself looking over her shoulder, increasingly terrified that her own past is catching up with her. As Kate beings to dig, to uncover the secrets of the people around her, she finds herself buried in layers of deceit so thick they threaten her family, her marriage, and her life.Hailed by The New York Times as “smartly executed [and] thoroughly captivating,” The Expats proves Chris Pavone to be a writer of tremendous talent.",

Everyone is welcome to attend whether or not you have read the selected book for that meeting. This is a drop-in event. We gather in person at the Fairfax Library for this conversation.We will be discussing our selection: Isola by Allegra Goodman \"Heir to a fortune, Marguerite is destined for a life of prosperity and gentility. Then she is orphaned, and her guardian--an enigmatic and volatile man--spends her inheritance and insists she accompany him on an expedition to New France. Isolated and afraid, Marguerite befriends her guardian's servant and the two develop an intense attraction. But when their relationship is discovered, they are brutally punished and abandoned on a small island with no hope for rescue. Once a child of privilege who dressed in gowns and laced pearls in her hair, Marguerite finds herself at the mercy of nature. As the weather turns, blanketing the island in ice, she discovers a faith she'd never before needed. Inspired by the real life of a sixteenth-century heroine, Isola is the timeless story of a woman fighting for survival\"--Amazon.comAvailable Formats: Print Book & Large-Type Print, Audiobook Download, E-Print bookFairfax Book Club is sponsored by the Friends of the Fairfax Library.

It can be slipped into a drink, smeared onto the tip of an arrow or the handle of a door, even filtered through the air we breathe. But how exactly do these poisons work to break our bodies down, and what can we learn from the damage they inflict?In a fascinating blend of popular science, medical history, and true crime, Dr. Neil Bradbury explores this most morbidly captivating method of murder from a cellular level. Alongside real-life accounts of murderers and their crimes—some notorious, some forgotten, some still unsolved—are the equally compelling stories of the poisons involved: eleven molecules of death that work their way through the human body and, paradoxically, illuminate the way in which our bodies function.",
