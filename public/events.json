I have a feeling that with this book, Patrick Ryan is going to be everyone's favorite author!\"-from Ann Patchett review ( NYT bestselling author of Tom Lake and The Dutch House)\"A small-town novel of epic proportions”, this captivating story weaves the intimate lives of two midwestern families across generations, from World War II to the late twentieth century.\"-Tom Perrotta“I love this book with my entire heart.”—Ann Napolitano (NYT bestselling author of Hello Beautiful)\"Sweeping yet intimate, rich with piercing observation and the warmth that comes from profound understanding of the human spirit, Buckeye captures the universal longing for love and for goodness.\" Good Reads",

There they must overcome their fears and solve the Ice Wizard’s riddle, because if Jack and Annie don’t complete their mission in time, Merlin and Morgan will disappear forever! This book will be read in three parts on January 15, 22, and 29. About Our Book Club: Each week, an AAC user hosts our sessions, and a librarian reads our story. After each reading, we enjoy an activity or game connected to the book, celebrating representation, creativity, and the many wonderful ways people communicate. We celebrate all forms of communication—AAC, speech, gestures, and expressions—and follow a Floortime-inspired approach that centers on meeting readers where they are and building joyful shared experiences. When applicable, a visual schedule will be emailed 24 hours before each session to help our readers follow along. Special thanks to Mary Pope Osborne and Penguin Random House for allowing us to read The Magic Tree House Merlin Missions: #4 Winter of the Ice Wizard in our virtual book club.",

      "description": "Join us in January for a discussion of The Comfort of Crows Follow the creatures and plants in the author's backyard over the course of a year. As we move through the seasons, from a crow spied on New Year’s Day, its resourcefulness and sense of community setting a theme for the year, to the lingering bluebirds of December, what develops is a portrait of joy and grief: joy in the ongoing pleasures of the natural world, and grief over winters that end too soon and songbirds that grow fewer and fewer. The city and the country transform a little more with each passing day, and “radiant things are bursting forth in the darkest places, in the smallest nooks and deepest cracks of the hidden world.”Books will be available to check out at the Bucktown-Wicker Park Branch circulation desk.

This month, we are reading Jess Walter's So Far Gone. From the #1 New York Times–bestselling author of Beautiful Ruins comes a lively, smart, and deliciously funny new novel in the vein of True Grit, about a reclusive journalist who is suddenly thrown into a wild, suspenseful journey to rescue his kidnapped grandchildren. “This work is a tremendous achievement: more literary and ambitious than Walter's previous popular books, with an urgency that may make it one of the strongest realist but dystopian novels of the present era.”—Library Journal",

We do this by highlighting two books each month written by authors of color. In addition to building community with folks across the country, we also send our monthly book picks to incarcerated comrades through our Prison Program. January's Book Selection is Nervous Conditions by Tsitsi DangaremgbaImmediately hailed as a classic (Atlantic Monthly called it the best contemporary novel on colonialism to be written by an African woman), Nervous Conditions is a wrenching chronicle of the coming of age of Tambu, a teenage girl in 1960s Rhodesia, and her relationship with her British-educated cousin, Nyasha. Tambu, who yearns to be free of the constraints of her rural village, thinks her dreams have come true when her wealthy uncle offers to sponsor her education. But education at his mission school comes with a price. There she meets sophisticated Nyasha, whose rebellion against her father brings disaster. With irony and skill, Dangarembga explores the struggle of two young women to liberate themselves in a society still suffering the effects of colonization. This edition of this highly acclaimed novel is \"an expression of liberation not to be missed.\" -- Alice Walker",

But what the fables forget is that mermaids have teeth. And now, her daughters have devoured the kingdom and burned it to ashes. On the run, the mermaid is joined by a mysterious plague doctor with a darkness of their own. Deep in the eerie, snow-crusted forest, the pair stumble upon a village of ageless children who thirst for blood, and the three 'saints' who control them. The mermaid and her doctor must embrace the cruelest parts of their true nature if they hope to survive\"-- Books are available to check out at various Chicago Public Library locations.

Isabel Dalhousie is fond of problems, and sometimes she becomes interested in problems that are, quite frankly, none of her business. This may be the case when Isabel sees a young man plunge to his death from the upper circle of a concert hall in Edinburgh. Despite the advice of her housekeeper, Grace, who has been raised in the values of traditional Edinburgh, and her niece, Cat, who, if you ask Isabel, is dating the wrong man, Isabel is determined to find the truth-if indeed there is one-behind the man's death. The resulting moral labyrinth might have stymied even Kant. And then there is the unsatisfactory turn of events in Cat's love life that must be attended to.Books are available at the Rogers Park Branch Reference Desk.

This month's discussion is: The Family Chao by Lan Samantha Chang. \"An acclaimed storyteller returns with \"a gorgeous and gripping literary mystery\" that explores \"family, betrayal, passion, race, culture and the American Dream\" (Jean Kwok). The residents of Haven, Wisconsin have dined on the Fine Chao restaurant's delicious Americanized Chinese food for thirty-five years, happy to ignore any unsavory whispers about the family owners. But when brash, charismatic, and tyrannical patriarch Leo Chao is found dead-presumed murdered-his sons find they've drawn the exacting gaze of the entire town. The Family Chao offers a kaleidoscopic, highly entertaining portrait of a Chinese American family grappling with the dark undercurrents of a seemingly pleasant small town.\" Pick up a copy of the book at the Circulation Desk. Space is limited. Registration is required. For teens and adults ages 13 and up. AccessibilityNeed sign language interpretation or other accessibility assistance for this event?

So what if June edits Athena's novel and sends it to her agent as her own work? So what if she lets her new publisher rebrand her as Juniper Song--complete with an ambiguously ethnic author photo?

We'll feature different titles and authors each month. Come and share your impressions, thoughts and interpretations of a book we have all read. This month we will be reading Normal People by Sally Rooney.\"Connell Waldron is one of the most popular boys in his small-town high school--he is a star of the football team, an excellent student, and never wanting for attention from girls. The one thing he doesn't have is money. Marianne Sheridan, a classmate of Connell's, has the opposite problem. Marianne is plain-looking, odd, and stubborn, and while her family is well-off, she has no friends to speak of. There is, however, a deep and undeniable connection between the two teenagers, one that develops into a secret relationship. Everything changes when both Connell and Marianne are accepted to Trinity College. Suddenly Marianne is well-liked and elegant, holding court with her intellectual friends while Connell hangs at the sidelines, not quite as fluent in language of the elite. Throughout their years at university, Marianne and Connell circle each other, falling in and out of romance but never straying far from where they started. And as Marianne experiments with an increasingly dangerous string of boyfriends, Connell must decide how far he is willing to go to save his oldest friend.\"Please login to your account with your library card and then register to reserve a copy of the book.",

The Murderbot Diaries Vol 1 description:On a distant planet, a team of scientists are conducting surface tests, shadowed by their Company-supplied ‘droid ― a self-aware SecUnit that has hacked its own governor module, and refers to itself (though never out loud) as “Murderbot.” Scornful of humans, all it really wants is to be left alone long enough to figure out who it is (and to watch its favorite show in its downtime.) But when a neighboring mission goes dark, it’s up to the scientists and Murderbot to get to the truth.",

Join the new Metro Year of the Book Club to read all of the monthly featured titles we are recommending this year, followed by a lively discussion of the book at the end of the month. We can't wait to meet you at the library! January's selection is The Library Book by Susan Orlean:In this lively and multilayered portrait of the Los Angeles Public Library by Orlean (The Orchid Thief), the author describes a source as \"electrified by everything he told me about the library.\" The same can be said for Orlean, whose enthusiasm and affection for the nearly 150-year-old institution is contagious. As in previous books and essays, Orlean assembles a panoramic profile from an array of fascinating details, from the library's earliest days as a reading room to its current thriving community presence as a provider of English classes, sheet -music for orchestras, services for the homeless, and more, including sketches of its charismatic-sometimes eccentric--directors, staff, and patrons. This sweeping, cheerful history revolves around a singular, terrible event: the 1986 fire that ravaged the Central Library, destroying some 400,000 books. Orlean's affecting account of the tragedy and its painful aftermath, as well as the many people it touched, points to a suspect who was never indicted. But the overall tone is warm and engaging, offering a love letter to libraries everywhere.

      "description": "Join us for a discussion of the delightful, award-winning 2025 memoir, Poets Square.\"When Courtney Gustafson moved into a rental house in the Poets Square neighborhood of Tucson, Arizona, she didn't know that the property came with thirty feral cats. Focused only on her own survival--in a new relationship, during a pandemic, with poor mental health and a job that didn't pay enough--Courtney was reluctant to spend any of her own time or money caring for the wayward animals. But the cats--their pleading eyes, their ribs showing, the new kittens born in the driveway--didn't give her a choice. She had no idea about the grief and hardship of animal rescue, the staggering size of the problem in neighborhoods across the country. And she couldn't have imagined how that struggle--towards an ethics of care, of individuals trying their best amidst spectacularly failing systems--would help pierce a darkness she'd wrestled for with much of her life.\"AccessibilityNeed sign language interpretation or other accessibility assistance for this event?

One tells the story of your life as it is, along with another book for the other life you could have lived if you had made a different choice at any point in your life. While we all wonder how our lives might have been, what if you had the chance to go to the library and see for yourself? Would any of these other lives truly be better?\" Pick up a copy of the book at the Circulation Desk. Space is limited. Registration is required. For adults 18 and up.

      "description": "Join us usually, but not always, on the third Monday of each month at 7:00 pm for the Strange New Worlds book club! This month's book is The Cautious Traveller's Guide to the Wastelands by Sarah Brooks. From the Publisher: \"For fans of Piranesi and The Midnight Library, a stunning historical fantasy novel set on a grand express train, about a group of passengers on a dangerous journey across a magical landscape. It is said there is a price that every passenger must pay. A price beyond the cost of a ticket. There is only one way to travel across the Wastelands: on the Trans-Siberian Express, a train as famous for its luxury as for its danger. The train is never short of passengers, eager to catch sight of Wastelands creatures more miraculous and terrifying than anything they could imagine. But on the train's last journey, something went horribly wrong, though no one seems to remember what exactly happened. Not even Zhang Weiwei, who has spent her life onboard and thought she knew all of the train's secrets. Now, the train is about to embark again, with a new set of passengers. Among them are Marya Petrovna, a grieving woman with a borrowed name; Henry Grey, a disgraced naturalist looking for redemption; and Elena, a beguiling stowaway with a powerful connection to the Wastelands itself. Weiwei knows she should report Elena, but she can't help but be drawn to her. As the girls begin a forbidden friendship, there are warning signs that the rules of the Wastelands are changing, and the train might once again be imperiled. Can the passengers trust each other, as the wildness outside threatens to consume them all?\" This program will be provided by Charlotte Mecklenburg Library staff and our wonderful Volunteer leader. Information about this Group The Strange New Worlds Book Club meets on the 3rd Monday of the month to discuss Science Fiction and Fantasy titles. How to Join an Online ProgramThis event will take place Zoom and in person. Please call 704-416-4000 for more information. Please register by 10:00 am the day of the event.

The Science Fiction Book Club meets at it's new day and time, on the 4th Monday of every month, at the Pearl Avenue Library, and on Zoom (as a hybrid meeting), starting at 4:00 p.m. Be sure to register to receive the zoom link, otherwise, we will see you at the library! Monday, January 26, 4:00 p.m. - Continuum: French Science Fiction Short Stories, ed. by Annabelle Dolidon, with Tessa Sermet.This unique collection of newly translated short stories offers a taste of classic and contemporary French science fiction to English-language readers. These stories cover a range of fascinating topics including simulated reality, speciesism, ecology, and transhumanism-all while exploring universal themes of belonging, death, and identity. Some of the authors featured in this anthology, like Julia Verlanger, Sylvie Denis, or Jean-Claude Dunyach, have shaped the history of French science fiction after World War II. Curated by Annabelle Dolidon and Tessa Sermet, French language and literature professors who share a love for the genre, these nine stories showcase some of the brilliant mid- to late twentieth century and twentieth century French contributions to science fiction. Dolidon and Sermet provide illuminating expansions that accompany each tale and fascinating insights into the evolution of French and American science fiction.

After overriding its control module, Murderbot becomes a free agent.

But keeping them alive on an alien planet proves to be harder than expected.For accessibility accommodations, please call 314-241-2288.",

Fearing dismissal, Maisie is shocked when she discovers that her thirst for education is to be supported by Lady Rowan and a family friend, Dr. Maurice Blanche. But The Great War intervenes in Maisie’s plans, and soon after commencement of her studies at Girton College, Cambridge, Maisie enlists for nursing service overseas.Years later, in 1929, having apprenticed to the renowned Maurice Blanche, a man revered for his work with Scotland Yard, Maisie sets up her own business. Her first assignment, a seemingly tedious inquiry involving a case of suspected infidelity, takes her not only on the trail of a killer, but back to the war she had tried so hard to forget.\"We will be making Oatmeal Brown Betties to accompany our discussion of the book.

Whether you loved it, loathed it, or left it unfinished, we want to hear your take. Come share your impressions and connect with fellow readers! This week we will be reading Vera Wong's Unsolicited Advice for Murder by Jesse Q. Sutanto. \"Knives Out meets Kim's Convenience in this captivating mystery by Jesse Q. Sutanto, bestselling author of Dial A for Aunties. Vera Wong is a lonely little old lady-ah, lady of a certain age-who lives above her forgotten tea shop in the middle of San Francisco's Chinatown. Despite living alone, Vera is not needy, oh no. She likes nothing more than sipping on a good cup of Wulong and doing some healthy detective work on the Internet about what her college-aged son is up to. Then one morning, Vera trudges downstairs to find a curious thing-a dead man in the middle of her tea shop. In his outstretched hand, a flash drive. Vera doesn't know what comes over her, but after calling the cops like any good citizen would, she sort of . . . swipes the flash drive from the body and tucks it safely into the pocket of her apron. Why? Because Vera is sure she would do a better job than the police possibly could, because nobody sniffs out a wrongdoing quite like a suspicious Chinese mother with time on her hands. Vera knows the killer will be back for the flash drive; all she has to do is watch the increasing number of customers at her shop and figure out which one among them is the killer. What Vera does not expect is to form friendships with her customers and start to care for each and every one of them. As a protective mother hen, will she end up having to give one of her newfound chicks to the police?\"--Provided by publisher.",

This month we are discussing: A Gentleman in Moscow by Amor TowlesFrom the Publisher:In 1922, Count Alexander Rostov is deemed an unrepentant aristocrat by a Bolshevik tribunal, and is sentenced to house arrest in the Metropol, a grand hotel across the street from the Kremlin. Rostov, an indomitable man of erudition and wit, has never worked a day in his life, and must now live in an attic room while some of the most tumultuous decades in Russian history are unfolding outside the hotel’s doors. Unexpectedly, his reduced circumstances provide him entry into a much larger world of emotional discovery.Brimming with humor, a glittering cast of characters, and one beautifully rendered scene after another, this singular novel casts a spell as it relates the count’s endeavor to gain a deeper understanding of what it means to be a man of purpose.",

      "description": "Love watching true crime documentaries and tv shows? Can't get enough of true crime podcasts? This is a monthly book group focused on reading and discussing True Crime. Join us on Zoom to discuss Yellow Bird: Oil, Murder, and a Woman's Search for Justice in Indian Country by Sierra Crane Murdoch. Yellow Bird\"When Lissa Yellow Bird was released from prison in 2009, she found her home, the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in North Dakota, transformed by the Bakken oil boom. In her absence, the landscape had been altered beyond recognition, her tribal government swayed by corporate interests, and her community burdened by a surge in violence and addiction. Three years later, when Lissa learned that a young white oil worker, Kristopher “KC” Clarke, had disappeared from his reservation worksite, she became particularly concerned. No one knew where Clarke had gone, and few people were actively looking for him. Yellow Bird traces Lissa’s steps as she obsessively hunts for clues to Clarke’s disappearance. She navigates two worlds—that of her own tribe, changed by its newfound wealth, and that of the non-Native oilmen, down on their luck, who have come to find work on the heels of the economic recession. Her pursuit of Clarke is also a pursuit of redemption, as Lissa atones for her own crimes and reckons with generations of trauma. Yellow Bird is an exquisitely written, masterfully reported story about a search for justice and a remarkable portrait of a complex woman who is smart, funny, eloquent, compassionate, and—when it serves her cause—manipulative. Drawing on eight years of immersive investigation, Sierra Crane Murdoch has produced a profound examination of the legacy of systematic violence inflicted on a tribal nation and a tale of extraordinary healing.\" -From the publisher",

      "description": "Join us on the 4th Wednesday of each month at 12:00 Noon for The History and Historical Fiction Book Club! This month we'll be discussing The Paris Express by Emma Donoghue. From Booklist: \"On the morning of October 22, 1895, the Paris Express leaves the town of Granville in Normandy for its seven-hour, ten-minute trip to the capital. Unbeknownst to its many passengers, the train is hurtling toward a crashing halt. Donoghue (Learned by Heart, 2023) superbly portrays the lead-up to the Montparnasse derailment, a disaster memorialized in astounding photographs, as experienced by travelers of diverse nationalities and social classes. Among them are a mixed-race American painter aspiring to greater achievements, an Algerian coffee-seller, a young boy bravely journeying alone, a female physiology student who observes classic signs of disease in a teenage girl in her car, and married workmen who enjoy a unique partnership. Quietly, an anarchist on board weighs the right moment to strike. Always balancing safety with keeping on schedule, crewmen feel pressured to make up any lost time. The pacing ramps up further midway through, the atmosphere tense. Donoghue's particular forte lies in showing how confined circumstances shape interactions. Her characterization is a marvel as she dexterously illustrates people's outward appearances and innermost desires. In her hands, the novel's long-ago setting becomes an exciting place buzzing with fresh life and technological ideas on the cusp of a new century, even as horror strikes.\" This program will be provided by the Davidson library staff. Information about this Group The History and Historical Fiction Book Club meets monthly to discuss Fiction and Nonfiction titles. How to Join an Online ProgramThis event takes place on Zoom. Please register by 9:00 am the morning of the event. You’ll receive an email with a secure Zoom link with a reminder about the meeting.Looking for more technology resources? Check out this list!",

This program is not led by an instructor--it's a social circle for sharing, building understanding and community. Meet up with other knitters or crocheters for self-directed projects in yarn and thread. Bring your own project to work on--no supplies are provided. While you're here, check out our many crafting books with knitting and crocheting projects to try. We meet weekly, every Wednesday afternoon from 1:00pm to 3:00 pm.

Indoor programs will be operating at a reduced attendance capacity and will include social distancing based on the library space. Want to be notified about future events?

This title should be on shelves and ready to borrow approximately 5 weeks prior to the discussion date. Check with a staff member if you have questions on how to access a copy.Book Description\"When renowned painter Mira Novak arrives at Wadia hospital in Bombay after a miscarriage, she's expected to make a quick recovery, and her nurse, Sona, is excited to learn more about the vivacious artist who shares her half-Indian identity. Sona, yearning for a larger life, finds herself carried away by Mira's stories of her travels and exploits and is shocked by accounts of the many lovers the painter has left scattered throughout Europe. When Mira dies quite suddenly and mysteriously, Sona falls under suspicion, and her quiet life is upended. The key to proving Sona's innocence may lie in a cryptic note and four paintings Mira left in her care, sending the young woman on a mission to visit the painter's former friends and lovers across a tumultuous Europe teetering toward war. On the precipice of discovering her own identity, Sona learns that the painter's charming facade hid a far more complicated, troubled soul. \"--Provided by publisher.",

The East Point Library has copies available in paperback, or you can check out this book as a downloadable audiobook and an eBook. Whether you love to read, want to make new friends, or are looking for a fun after-school activity, our Tween Book Club is a great way to connect with other book lovers and discover new stories together. Mark your calendars—our very first book club get-together is happening on January 28th at 4:00 pm! I can’t wait to chat about this book with you!",

When Mark is viciously attacked by an unknown assailant, he is forced on the run. From New York to Singapore to London, he chases after clues while dodging attacks and trying to solve the puzzle of who's after him. All without killing anyone. Or getting himself killed.

      "description": "Join us at Kobetich Branch to discuss a new book each month. This month we will be reading West with Giraffes by Lynda Rutledge. Please note our new meeting time of 4-5pm starting in January. An emotional, rousing novel inspired by the incredible true story of two giraffes who made headlines and won the hearts of Depression-era America. “Few true friends have I known and two were giraffes…” Woodrow Wilson Nickel, age 105, feels his life ebbing away. But when he learns giraffes are going extinct, he finds himself recalling the unforgettable experience he cannot take to his grave. It’s 1938. The Great Depression lingers. Hitler is threatening Europe, and world-weary Americans long for wonder. They find it in two giraffes who miraculously survive a hurricane while crossing the Atlantic. What follows is a twelve-day road trip in a custom truck to deliver Southern California’s first giraffes to the San Diego Zoo. Behind the wheel is the young Dust Bowl rowdy Woodrow. Inspired by true events, the tale weaves real-life figures with fictional ones, including the world’s first female zoo director, a crusty old man with a past, a young female photographer with a secret, and assorted reprobates as spotty as the giraffes. Part adventure, part historical saga, and part coming-of-age love story, West with Giraffes explores what it means to be changed by the grace of animals, the kindness of strangers, the passing of time, and a story told before it’s too late. The book is available for check out at the Kobetich circulation desk. The Kobetich Book Club meets on the last Wednesday of the month. New members are always welcome! Please call Kobetich library staff at 253-280-2921 for assistance with locating or reserving a copy.",

We'll feature different titles and authors each month. Come and share your impressions, thoughts and interpretations of a book we have all read.This month we will be reading Convenience Store Woman by Sayaka Murata.Convenience Store Woman is the heartwarming and surprising story of thirty-six-year-old Tokyo resident Keiko Furukura. Keiko has never fit in, neither in her family, nor in school, but when at the age of eighteen she begins working at the Hiiromachi branch of \"Smile Mart,\" she finds peace and purpose in her life. In the store, unlike anywhere else, she understands the rules of social interaction--many are laid out line by line in the store's manual--and she does her best to copy the dress, mannerisms, and speech of her colleagues, playing the part of a \"normal\" person excellently, more or less. Managers come and go, but Keiko stays at the store for eighteen years. It's almost hard to tell where the store ends and she begins. Keiko is very happy, but the people close to her, from her family to her coworkers, increasingly pressure her to find a husband, and to start a proper career, prompting her to take desperate action... A brilliant depiction of an unusual psyche and a world hidden from view, Convenience Store Woman is an ironic and sharp-eyed look at contemporary work culture and the pressures to conform, as well as a charming and completely fresh portrait of an unforgettable heroine.",

      "description": "TPL'S ONLINE SPECULATIVE FICTION BOOK GROUP! Regularly meets the last Wednesday of each month via Zoom to discuss intriguing, mind-expanding books from multiple genres. Register today and join us online. January 2026 Selection: Hyperion by Dan Simmons The first novel in Dan Simmons' critically acclaimed, award-winning Hyperion Cantos series. Considered a classic of 20th Century science fiction. On the world called Hyperion, beyond the reach of galactic law, waits a creature called the Shrike. There are those who worship it. There are those who fear it. And there are those who have vowed to destroy it. In the Valley of the Time Tombs, where huge, brooding structures move backward through time, the Shrike waits for them all. On the eve of Armageddon, with the entire galaxy at war, seven pilgrims set forth on a final voyage to Hyperion seeking the answers to the unsolved riddles of their lives. Each carries a desperate hope—and a terrible secret. And one may hold the fate of humanity in his hands. \"Mr. Simmons shuttles his characters through space and time with the enviable freedom that modern science fiction accords the untimid storyteller. He surrounds them with marvels of technology that they tend to take for granted, just as we do when we flick on a light switch or turn the ignition key in our car. These people are not scientists; they are less interested in comprehending or controlling the universe than in answering the question posed by all fiction that aspires to the status of literature: what does it mean to be human?\" — The New York Times Hyperion If all physical copies are checked out, additional eBook copies may be available in Libby/OverDrive Speculative Fiction? What's that? Do you like science fiction? That's speculative fiction. Fantasy? OK, that's speculative fiction too. Horror, magical realism, alternate history, slipstream, steampunk, cyberpunk, dystopias, apocalyptic tales, and stories that are just plain weird? Yep. Those are all eligible for our speculative fiction menu!If reading outside the lines of everyday life interests you, we invite you to join our online community as we explore our reading horizons. Other Worlds might be the change of pace you're looking for.",

We're an \"UnBook Club!\" What's an Unbook Club, you ask? We don't all agree to read the same things. (After all, some like shojo more than shonen, or like the mecha genre more than the magical girls type. Some might even like both!) Here we all take turns sharing what we're currently reading, give and ask for recommendations, and share our love of manga! We play games, watch anime, make crafts, and hang out. Join us every last Thursday of the month at 4:30 p.m. in the community room. Looking for some manga to read? Check out our catalog and place a hold, or come explore our graphic novel section in the branch. Find a link to our catalog by clicking here. Information about this Group The Davidson Teen Manga Mashup meets monthly to discuss manga and graphic novel titles. This program will be provided by Davidson library staff, and is recommended for teens ages 12 to 18. A place for likeminded individuals to appreciate and explore the culture of Japan through one of its most popular forms of art and entertainment. Want to stay in the know about programs and resources for teens? Follow us @cmlibraryteens on Instagram.",

There they must overcome their fears and solve the Ice Wizard’s riddle, because if Jack and Annie don’t complete their mission in time, Merlin and Morgan will disappear forever! This book will be read in three parts on January 15, 22, and 29. About Our Book Club: Each week, an AAC user hosts our sessions, and a librarian reads our story. After each reading, we enjoy an activity or game connected to the book, celebrating representation, creativity, and the many wonderful ways people communicate. We celebrate all forms of communication—AAC, speech, gestures, and expressions—and follow a Floortime-inspired approach that centers on meeting readers where they are and building joyful shared experiences. When applicable, a visual schedule will be emailed 24 hours before each session to help our readers follow along. Special thanks to Mary Pope Osborne and Penguin Random House for allowing us to read The Magic Tree House Merlin Missions: #4 Winter of the Ice Wizard in our virtual book club.",

Practice reading and speaking English while having fun and making new friends. For the month of November, we will be reading Park Avenue by Renée Ahdieh.Jia Song has always been destined for greatness. As the daughter of Korean bodega owners, she promised herself that she would have every Fifth Avenue luxury when she grew up, and it is all finally within reach. She has just made junior partner at her prestigious Manhattan law firm, she can count on her two best friends to have her back, and she is about to score the ultraluxe gold-on-gold Birkin bag of her dreams. So when her boss asks her to sit in on the hush-hush family implosion of a high-level client, she accepts without hesitation―only to find out that it is one of the most famous Korean families in the world.The Park family’s net worth is estimated at a billion dollars, and their megasuccessful Korean beauty brand has shaped the culture for the past two decades. But the patriarch is filing for divorce while his wife is dying, and their three children can’t stop snapping at one another. With both the family fortune and legacy under threat from the worst kind of scandal, it’s up to Jia to set things right―and she only has a month to do it.As Jia sorts through the lies and subterfuge, chasing the truth across the globe on private jets, she finds herself falling for this broken, badly-behaving family in ways she can’t quite explain. But it is also becoming clear that the Parks are hiding dark secrets. Can she find the truth in time to protect the Parks’ fortune and secure her success at the firm? And can she hold on to what’s most important, even if it means admitting that what she's always wanted isn’t what she actually needs?Digital and hard copies are available in the catalog. Registration is required.

The Murderbot Diaries Vol 1 description:On a distant planet, a team of scientists are conducting surface tests, shadowed by their Company-supplied ‘droid ― a self-aware SecUnit that has hacked its own governor module, and refers to itself (though never out loud) as “Murderbot.” Scornful of humans, all it really wants is to be left alone long enough to figure out who it is (and to watch its favorite show in its downtime.) But when a neighboring mission goes dark, it’s up to the scientists and Murderbot to get to the truth.",

About the Book: My Antonia by Willa Cather \"In Jim Burden's accounting of his life with, and without, Antonia Shimerda, listeners are transported to the hardscrabble Nebraska prairie and the rural immigrant experience. When Jim first sees the Shimerda family, immigrants from Bohemia, disembarking from the same train that is taking him West to live with his grandparents, he has no idea the impact they will have on his life. Nostalgically, he remembers the good and bad times they had on their respective farms and creates his portrait of Antonia, an independent and tough survivor.\"-- Lynn Evarts, Sauk Prairie High School, Prairie du Sac, WA in School Library Journal ADA Accommodation Request | Solicitud de Adaptación ADA",

SynopsisOn the first Tuesday in October, Rosa Hartung is returning to her job as minister for social affairs following a year's leave of absence--granted after the dramatic disappearance of her twelve-year-old daughter. Linus Bekker, a mentally ill young man, confessed to her killing, but is unable to remember where he buried the various parts of her dismembered corpse, leaving Rosa with no choice but to try to move on without closure. The same day Rosa returns to parliament, a young single mother is found brutally murdered at her home in the suburbs of Copenhagen--she's been tortured, and one hand has been cut off. Thulin and Hess, the detectives sent to investigate the crime, arrive at the address to find a figure made of chestnuts hanging from a playhouse nearby. When yet another woman is murdered--this time with both hands cut off--and another chestnut figure is found, Thulin and Hess begin to suspect a connection to the Hartung case. To put an end to the killing spree, the pair, with nothing in common aside from equally troubled personal lives, realize they will need to put aside their differences in a race against time--and a brutal psychopath.The Chestnut Man Library staff may take photos, videos, or audio recordings at our events. Please tell us if you do not wish to be photographed, video-recorded, or audio-recorded. We will always respect your requests! An ASL (American Sign Language) interpreter or closed captioning can be provided for this program if requested at least seven (7) days in advance.

      "description": "Our book club meets monthly at the library to discuss books set in Oakland and the Bay Area or by Bay Area authors. We select our books from a variety of genres and eras so you’re sure to find something you’re interested in. We’ll get to learn more about our city, meet some neighbors and discuss what we’ve read. This year we’re mostly alternating fiction and non-fiction books. Meetings are the first Tuesday of the month (note the change from 2025!) from 6:30-7:30pm. Come to one discussion, a few or all of them! No pre-registration or commitment is required – all we ask is that you’ve read at least some of the book and are ready to discuss it. Here’s our 2026 schedule: (Quoted descriptions are from the library catalog unless otherwise noted.) January 6, 2026: Sourdough by Robin Sloan (fiction)We’re kicking off the year with a quick read about the very Bay Area intersection of tech and food culture. Lois is an exhausted software engineer who is gifted a very special sourdough starter by her favorite bakers when they must flee the country. Pretty soon she’s part of a mysterious underground food scene at the former Alameda Naval Air Station. February 3, 2026: Family Style: Memories of An American From Vietnam by Thien Pham (graphic memoir)The book that got the most votes from our members on our year-end poll! “Told through the lens of meaningful food and meals, this graphic novel chronicles the author’s childhood immigration to America, where food takes on new meaning as he and his family search for belonging, for happiness and for the American dream.” Pham is a graphic novelist, comic artist and educator based in Oakland. March 3, 2026: Deep Care: The Radical Activists Who Provided Abortions, Defied the Law, and Fought to Keep Clinics Open by Angela Hume (non-fiction)“The story of the radical feminist networks who worked outside the law to defend abortion. Deep Care follows generations of activists and clinicians who orbited the Women’s Choice clinic in Oakland from the early 1970s until 2010, as they worked underground and above ground, in small cells and broad coalitions and across political movements with grit, conviction, and allegiances of great trust to do what they believed needed to be done–despite the law, when required.” April 7, 2026: Moonglow by Michael Chabon (fiction)“A man bears witness to his grandfather’s deathbed confessions, which reveal his family’s long-buried history and his involvement in a mail-order novelty company, World War II and the space program.” Most of it isn’t set in Oakland, but it is the only book on this list that specifically mentions Montclair Library! May 5, 2026: Automatic Noodle by Annalee Newitz (science fiction)Our May read is a slim 163 pages, but packed with interesting ideas. This book is super popular as of December 2025, so you might want to get your hold in early. “In this semicozy tale set in a dystopian near future, robots open their own restaurant, build an unusual found family and achieve personal growth. A few years after the war that led to California’s secession from the United States, four robots awake in the flooded San Francisco takeout place where they were contracted to work.” (Kirkus) “Emboldened by newly granted civil rights from the California government, the bots reboot their lives in classic Bay Area form: by opening a noodle shop…In many ways, Newitz’s near-future San Francisco resembles today’s city, with not-so-subtle nods to AI anxieties, queer identity and the modern-day immigrant experience. It is, in the words of KQED’s Alexis Madrigal, ‘The most San Francisco book that has ever been or could ever have been written.’” (Leah Worthington) (Ebook listed separately) June 2, 2026: Moneyball by Michael Lewis (non-fiction)Baseball season is in full swing, which makes this the perfect time to read Michael Lewis’s nuanced exploration of “how Billy Beene, the general manager of the Oakland Athletics, used a new kind of thinking to build a successful and winning baseball team without spending enormous sums of money.” July 7, 2026: Girls Girls Girls by Shoshana von Blanckensee (fiction)In the summer of 1996, best friends (and secret girlfriends), Hannah and Sam drive from “New York, to the fabled queer paradise of San Francisco, free from the harsh gazes of their neighbors and the stifling demands of Hannah’s devout Orthodox Jewish mother. In San Francisco, they will finally be together as a real couple, out in the open, around other queer people.” But soon they’re working at a strip club, meeting new people and trying to figure out who just they are. August 4, 2026: Power Hungry: Women of the Black Panther Party and Freedom Summer and Their Fight to Feed a Movement by Suzanne Cope (non-fiction)Journey back with us to the summer of 1969 with the story of the free breakfast movement, grocery giveaways and other nurturing mutual aid programs started by the Black Panthers. “NYU writing professor Cope rescues two female activists from obscurity in this intriguing look at the role that food played in the civil rights and Black Power movements.” If you read One Crazy Summer with us in 2025, you’ll enjoy learning the backstory to the Panthers’ food program. September 1, 2026: Kasher in the Rye by Moshe Kasher (memoir)Go back to school with this “hilarious memoir about the absurdity of addiction.” “When he was a young boy, Kasher’s mother took him on a vacation to the West Coast. Well it was more like an abduction…They moved to Oakland, California. That’s where the real fun begins, in the war zone of Oakland Public Schools. Those early years read like part Augusten Burroughs, part David Sedaris, with a touch of Jim Carrol….Brutally honest and laugh-out-loud funny, Kasher…finds humor in even the most horrifying situations.” October 6, 2026: 107 Days by Kamala Harris (memoir)Hopefully by October the miles-long hold list for this book will have settled down enough for you to get a copy! “For the first time, and with surprising and revealing insights, Kamala Harris tells the story of one of the wildest and most consequential presidential campaigns in American history.” (NPR) November 3, 2026: The Giveaway: The Clay Blackburn Story by Owen Hill (crime fiction)We have something noir-ish by an Oakland author for those long November nights. “Hill’s crime fiction is whip-smart, stylish, subversive, hilarious and just dripping with East Bay color, culture and landmarks. Sweet and sour like a perfect Negroni, Hill has invented a new kind of East Bay Noir — the fog rolls in late, the golden afternoon glow somehow both luxurious and ominous in the class war that never sleeps.” (Recommendation from Tally Ho! Books via Oaklandside) December 1, 2026: Sign My Name to Freedom by Betty Reid Soskin (memoir)Reid Soskin, famous for being the oldest park ranger in the history of the National Park Service while working at the Rosie the Riveter National Park in Richmond, has been witness to a wide sweep of American history. She grew up in the Bay Area, raised four kids, ran a record store in Berkeley and more. “Betty just turned 104 and her memoir gives a fascinating look at African Americans migration, the Rosie the Riveter story, and beyond through the Civil Rights era.” (recommender) (Ebook and audiobook listed separately) « See our 2025 books here »« See our 2024 books here »« See our 2023 books here »Learn more about Montclair Library and its Friends group, FOML, here: About | Friends of Montclair Library",

      "description": "Do you want to explore what the horror genre has to offer? Boos and Brews is for you! Join us at the Bellbrook Brewing Company! for Adults 18+.-- This month we are reading Episode Thirteen by Craig DiLouie. Fade to Black is the newest hit ghost hunting reality TV show. It's led by husband and wife team Matt and Claire Kirklin and features a dedicated crew of ghost-hunting experts. Episode Thirteen takes them to Matt's holy grail: the Paranormal Research Foundation. This crumbling, derelict mansion holds secrets and clues about the bizarre experiments that took place there in the 1970s. It's also, undoubtedly, haunted, and Matt hopes to use their scientific techniques and high tech gear to prove it. But, as the house begins to slowly reveal itself to them, proof of an afterlife might not be everything Matt dreamed of. A story told in broken pieces, in tapes, journals, correspondence, and research files, this is the story of Episode Thirteen--and how everything went horribly wrong. Pick up your copy at the Winters Community Library Reference Desk. Boos and Brews meets in the loft at Bellbrook Brewing Company, located at 26 East Franklin Street, Bellbrook, Ohio 45305. A variety of beverages are available for purchase from Bellbrook Brewing Company, To receive updates regarding this event, please register.",

For February, the Mystery Book Club is reading Leave No Trace by A. J. Landau.\"In a daring, brutal act of terrorism, an explosion rocks and topples the Statue of Liberty. Special Agent Michael Walker of the National Park Service is awakened by his boss with that news and sent to New York as the agent-in-charge. Not long after he lands, he learns two things - one that Gina Delgado of the FBI has been placed in charge of the investigation as the lead of the Joint Terrorism Task Force and two, that threats of a second terrorism attack are already being called into the media. While barred from the meetings of the Joint Task Force for his lack of security clearance, Walker finds a young boy among the survivors with a critical piece of information - a video linking the attackers to the assault. As a radical domestic terrorist group, led by a shadowy figure known only as Jeremiah, threatens further attacks against America's cultural symbols, powerful forces within the government are misleading the investigation to further their own radical agenda\" We meet on the first Wednesday of each month at 6:30 – 7:45 PM in the upstairs Conference Room.

Bring food related to the book to share.---Based on an Athabascan Indian legend passed along for many generations from mothers to daughters of the upper Yukon River Valley in Alaska, this is the suspenseful, shocking, ultimately inspirational tale of two old women abandoned by their tribe during a brutal winter famine.Though these women have been known to complain more than contribute, they now must either survive on their own or die trying. In simple but vivid detail, Wallis depicts a landscape and way of life that are at once merciless and starkly beautiful. In her old women, she has created two heroines of steely determination whose story of betrayal, friendship, community, and forgiveness \"speaks straight to the heart with clarity, sweetness, and wisdom\" (Ursula K. Le Guin).",

Instead of marriage, Jacquotte dreams of joining the seafarers and smugglers whose tall-masted ships cluster in the turquoise waters around Tortuga. In Haiti she becomes Jacques, a dockworker, earning the respect of those around her while hiding her gender. Jacquotte discovers that secret identities are fairly common in the chaotic world of seafaring, which is full of outsiders and misfits. As Jacques, Jacquotte falls in love with Lizzôa d'Erville, a beautiful courtesan who deals in secrets and sex. While others see their work clothes as a disguise, Lizzôa’s true self is as a woman. For the next twenty years, Jacquotte raids the Caribbean, making enemies and amassing a fortune in stolen gold. When her fellow pirates decide to increase their profits by entering the slave trade, Jacquotte turns away from piracy and the pursuit of riches.

      "description": "Join us for an unforgettable experience as we chat online with Vanessa Riley about her newest book, Fire Sword and Sea, based on the folk story of the female pirate Jacquotte Delahaye. The Caribbean Sea, 1675. Jacquotte Delahaye is the mixed-race daughter of a wealthy tavern owner on the island of Tortuga. Instead of marriage, Jacquotte dreams of joining the seafarers and smugglers whose tall-masted ships cluster in the turquoise waters around Tortuga. In Haiti she becomes Jacques, a dockworker, earning the respect of those around her while hiding her gender. Jacquotte discovers that secret identities are fairly common in the chaotic world of seafaring, which is full of outsiders and misfits. As Jacques, Jacquotte falls in love with Lizzôa d'Erville, a beautiful courtesan who deals in secrets and sex. While others see their work clothes as a disguise, Lizzôa’s true self is as a woman. For the next twenty years, Jacquotte raids the Caribbean, making enemies and amassing a fortune in stolen gold. When her fellow pirates decide to increase their profits by entering the slave trade, Jacquotte turns away from piracy and the pursuit of riches. Risking her life in one deadly skirmish after another, she instead begins to plot a war of liberation. Don’t miss out on this exciting discussion!

      "description": "Vanessa Riley delves into Fire Sword and Sea, her newest novel inspired by the legendary pirate Jacquotte Delahaye. Set in the Caribbean of 1675, the story follows Jacquotte as she rejects the life expected of her and disguises herself as “Jacques,” a dockworker who earns respect while concealing her identity. Amid the chaotic world of smugglers and seafarers, she forms deep connections, including a powerful bond with Lizzôa d’Erville, a courtesan who lives her own truth in a world of secrets. Over the next two decades, Jacquotte becomes a feared and successful pirate, amassing wealth and enemies across the Caribbean. But when her crew turns to the slave trade, she refuses to participate and instead risks everything to fight for liberation, transforming her life of piracy into a mission for justice.This program is part of Santa Clara County Library District's celebration of Silicon Valley Reads. --- The free, virtual series is open to the public and takes place two to three times a month.

      "description": "Each month, this book club will discuss books in a variety of genres, from fantasy to contemporary fiction, memoirs to graphic novels, and more! What these stories share in common is that they center authors or characters with queer identities. This club's main goal is to chat about books, but also provide a safe space for anyone in the LGBTQIAP+ community who deserve to see a version of themselves within the pages of a book. We also welcome allies wanting to expand their bookish horizons. We meet on the first Saturday of the month, with a couple exceptions due to holidays. For more info, including the club's reading list, go here or contact Adam at alopez@lplks.org",

      "description": "The Cupertino Adult Book Discussion Group is open to all adults who enjoying reading and discussing non-fictional literature. In February the book will be Connecting Dots: A Blind Life by Joshua A. Miele with Wendell Jamieson.Blinded as a young boy, Joshua A. Miele's autobiography talks about how he has negotiated life as a blind person in a world created for sighted people. A born problem solver and naturally curious Miele has spent his life not only figuring out how to live a full life, but helping other blind individuals do the same as an advocate for disability and accessibility. He chronicles the evolution of a number of revolutionary accessible technologies and his role in shaping them, including screen readers, tactile maps, and audio description. Along the way, he grappled with drugs and addiction, played bass in a rock band, worked for NASA, became a guerilla activist, and married the love of his life and had two children. The Adult Nonfiction Book Discussion Group meets on the second Sunday of each month at 11 am in Room 201B. All meetings are sponsored by The Friends of the Cupertino LibraryFor accessibility accommodations (ex. ASL), please fill out the online form at sccld.org/accessibility 7+days prior to the event.

We will introduce Volume 1 of a series to get you started on your next reading adventure. We encourage teens to read at least Volume 1, whether that is a physical copy from your own manga collection, from our library, or borrowed from a friend. Digital reading also counts; we will be happy to have you participate in our discussion if you have read an e-copy. Physical copies of Volume 1 will be available for in person pick-up at the Enon Branch on a first come, first served basis. Check out Libby and Hoopla for available digital copies. Scheduled for the second Monday of the month. For teens. This month's selection: Fall in Love You False Angels by Coco Uzuki Summary: All sugar, no spice, and everything nice...that's the impression the beautiful first-year high schooler and class president Otogi gives to those around her. One look from the school's \"heartthrob angel\" is all it takes to sweep countless admirers off their feet. But the real Otogi Katsura is no angel: She's calculating, ruthless, and sharp-tongued. When Otogi slips up and exposes her inner baddie in front of the class's other paragon, Toki, he counters by revealing an unexpected side of his own and declaring her his \"partner in crime.\" With cupid's arrow at her back, can the \"heartthrob angel\" maintain her perfect act and regain the upper hand, or will she be the one swept off her feet by a fellow false angel?!” Rated 13 +",

I don’t feel inspired by America at all,” and the chapters set outside of Africa make this abundantly clear.

      "description": "The Minnesota History Center is showcasing a number of unique items from the MNHS collections in an exhibit entitled “The Stories We Keep.” This exhibit features 25 objects from MNHS collections—a rich trove built on the generosity and foresight of thousands of people who have entrusted MNHS with their belongings and their stories. To celebrate the exhibit, the History Center has partnered with the Saint Paul Public Library to host a book club featuring Precious and Adored by Lizzie Ehrenhalt and Tilly Laskey. Precious and Adored highlights the correspondence between Rose Cleveland, sister of President Grover Cleveland, and Evangeline Simpson, a wealthy widow who would become the second wife of Henry Whipple, Minnesota's Episcopal bishop.

      "description": "Join us to celebrate the love of reading with others in our community! This month's selection is Mrs. Dalloway by Virginia Woolf. Heralded as Virginia Woolf's greatest novel, this is a vivid portrait of a single day in a woman's life. When we meet her, Mrs. Clarissa Dalloway is preoccupied with the last-minute details of party preparation while in her mind she is something much more than a perfect society hostess. As she readies her house, she is flooded with remembrances of faraway times. And, met with the realities of the present, Clarissa reexamines the choices that brought her there, hesitantly looking ahead to the unfamiliar work of growing old. Visit the following link to view all of Lynnwood Library Book Group's 2026 selections: Lynnwood Library Book Club 2026 Titles. Books are selected by members of the group and cover a variety of genres. The Lynnwood Library Book Group meets regularly on the second Monday of each month from 6:30-7:45pm.

We meet in person on the second Tuesday (usually) of the month, from 2 to 3 p.m. Registration is not required. (For December, we will meet on the third Tuesday.) Here is the list of titles we will read in 2026 (selection and sequencing subject to availability and the whims of the club leader). There is a monthly email newsletter with reminders and updates; if you would like to get signed up, and for any other questions, please call the Sahuarita Library at 520-594-5490. The book for our February meeting is The Orchid Thief, by Susan Orlean. The library has very few copies, so people attending this meeting might need to obtain their own copy of the book (in whatever format you choose).",

Additional copies of the book available at the YS community library. Book club co-sponsored with the Yellow Springs Community Library. Register for the book club at glenhelen.org.-- All flourishing is mutual”, author Kimmerer begins The Serviceberry. She then leads readers through a poetic, joyful path to the native berry patch and the idea of a gift economy. Kimmerer tells us “the serviceberry shows us another model, one based on reciprocity, where wealth comes from the quality of your relationships, not from the illusions of self-sufficiency.” A lighthearted read interwoven with themes of hope and generosity, defines gifts, whether a basket of juicy serviceberries or physical items, as a part of a moving, reciprocal economy able to bring joy and worthy of our attention.",

      "description": "The Page Turners is an evening book discussion group for adults that meets at the Castro Valley Library on the second Tuesday of the month at 7 pm. Facilitated by librarian Chris Selig, the discussions focus on compelling, well-reviewed fiction and nonfiction books written for adults.For February we will discuss James by Percival Everett, which is available for check out through the Library collection and Link Plus. Synopsis James, is a retelling of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, that is harrowing, ferociously funny and told from the enslaved Jim's point of view. When the enslaved Jim overhears that he is about to be sold to a man in New Orleans, separated from his wife and daughter forever, he decides to hide on nearby Jackson Island until he can formulate a plan. Meanwhile, Huck Finn has faked his own death to escape his violent father, recently returned to town. As all readers of American literature know, thus begins the dangerous and transcendent journey by raft down the Mississippi River toward the elusive and too-often-unreliable promise of the Free States and beyond. While many narrative set pieces of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn remain in place (floods and storms, stumbling across both unexpected death and unexpected treasure in the myriad stopping points along the river's banks, encountering the scam artists posing as the Duke and Dauphin...), Jim's agency, intelligence and compassion are shown in a radically new light.James _________ An ASL (American Sign Language) interpreter can be provided for this program if requested at least seven business days in advance.

Piranesi's house is no ordinary building: its rooms are infinite, its corridors endless, its walls are lined with thousands upon thousands of statues, each one different from all the others. Within the labyrinth of halls an ocean is imprisoned; waves thunder up staircases, rooms are flooded in an instant. But Piranesi is not afraid; he understands the tides as he understands the pattern of the labyrinth itself. He lives to explore the house. There is one other person in the house-a man called The Other, who visits Piranesi twice a week and asks for help with research into A Great and Secret Knowledge. But as Piranesi explores, evidence emerges of another person, and a terrible truth begins to unravel, revealing a world beyond the one Piranesi has always known. For readers of Neil Gaiman's The Ocean at the End of the Lane and fans of Madeline Miller's Circe, Piranesi introduces an astonishing new world, an infinite labyrinth, full of startling images and surreal beauty, haunted by the tides and the clouds",

Each month we'll read a book set in a different country then enjoy conversations about the book as well as other cultures and experiences. We'll read from multiple categories, including fiction, nonfiction, graphic novels, novels in verse, and more. This month we'll be reading and discussing Amal Unbound by Aisha Saeed and set in Pakistan. Please register then stop by the library for a free copy of the book no earlier than one month before the discussion.\"Twelve-year-old Amal's dream of becoming a teacher one day is dashed in an instant when she accidentally insults a member of her Pakistani village's ruling family. As punishment for her behavior, she is forced to leave her heartbroken family behind and go work at their estate. Amal is distraught but has faced setbacks before. So she summons her courage and begins navigating the complex rules of life as a servant, with all its attendant jealousies and pecking-order woes. Most troubling, though, is Amal's increasing awareness of the deadly measures the Khan family will go to in order to stay in control. It's clear that their hold over her village will never loosen as long as everyone is too afraid to challenge them--so if Amal is to have any chance of ensuring her loved ones' safety and winning back her freedom, she must find a way to work with the other servants to make it happen.\" Amal Unbound An ASL (American Sign Language) interpreter can be provided for this program if requested at least seven (7) business days in advance.

We meet once a month on a Wednesday in the months of October, November, December, February, March, and April at 6 p.m. We have a limited supply of free books for book club participants that will be available for pick up at the Dayton's Bluff Branch Library when selections become finalized. Participants will be notified by email. Books will also be available to borrow at the library. The Dayton’s Bluff Book Club is a collaboration of the Metropolitan State University Library and the Dayton’s Bluff Branch of Saint Paul Public Library whose members live, work or attend classes on the East Side. We prioritize our selection of titles to those written by Minnesota authors, that have a local setting, or that are written by people of color and other diverse authors. Book discussions usually include issues related to social justice, equity, and anti-racism. We encourage book club members to use both the university and public libraries in pursuit of lifelong learning and the joy of reading. Discussions are frequently facilitated by authors, Metropolitan State faculty, or other guests from the community.

Wednesday, February 11, 2026, 5:30 p.m. Iona Iverson's Rules for Commuting, by Clare Pooley.Nobody ever talks to strangers on the train. It's a rule. But what would happen if they did? From the New York Times bestselling author of The Authenticity Project, a heartwarming novel about unexpected friendships and the joy of connecting. Every day, Iona, a larger-than-life magazine advice columnist, travels the ten stops from Hampton Court to Waterloo Station by train, accompanied by her dog, Lulu. Every day she sees the same people, whom she knows only by nickname: Impossibly-Pretty-Bookworm and Terribly-Lonely-Teenager. Of course, they never speak. Seasoned commuters never do. Then one morning, the man she calls Smart-But-Sexist-Manspreader chokes on a grape right in front of her. He'd have died were it not for the timely intervention of Sanjay, a nurse, who gives him the Heimlich maneuver. This single event starts a chain reaction, and an eclectic group of people with almost nothing in common except their commute discover that a chance encounter can blossom into much more. It turns out that talking to strangers can teach you about the world around you--and even more about yourself. Wednesday, March 11, 2026, 5:30 p.m. \"Downton Shabby,\" by Hopwood DePree.

We will meet on the 2nd Thursday of the month at 10 am. What is a cozy mystery? The crime-solver is an amateur sleuth, who eavesdrops, gathers clues, and uses their native intelligence and knowledge of their community to solve the crime. Cozy mysteries are generally considered “gentle” books and most have no graphic violence. The setting is often a small town full of colorful characters.Series frequently have a prominent thematic element introduced by the detective's job, pet, or hobby.These books are plot and character driven with an emphasis on solving puzzles rather than suspense. Our chosen book with serve as our theme for the meeting, we will talk about other book series with a similar theme as well as the recipes, crafts, and more included in many cozies.",

This mystery book club generally meets on the 2nd Thursday of every month from 11:00-12:00n. All are welcome to join! Request a copy of the book online or ask at the Info Desk of the Civic Center Library (or call 415-473-6057) for assistance in placing a hold. Razorblade Tears (book) or Razorblade Tears (eAudiobook) by S.A. Cosby A Black father. A white father. Two murdered sons. A story of bloody retribution, heartfelt change, and maybe even redemption. Ike Randolph has been out of jail for fifteen years, with not so much as a speeding ticket in all that time. But a Black man with cops at the door knows to be afraid. The last thing he expects to hear is that his son Isiah has been murdered, along with Isiah’s white husband, Derek. Ike had never fully accepted his son but is devastated by his loss. Derek’s father Buddy Lee was almost as ashamed of Derek for being gay as Derek was ashamed of his father's criminal record. Buddy Lee still has contacts in the underworld, though, and he wants to know who killed his boy. Ike and Buddy Lee, two ex-cons with little else in common other than a criminal past and a love for their dead sons, band together in their desperate desire for revenge. In their quest to do better for their sons in death than they did in life, hardened men Ike and Buddy Lee will confront their own prejudices about their sons and each other, as they rain down vengeance upon those who hurt their boys. - adapted from the publisher ADA Accommodation Request | Solicitud de Adaptación ADA",

Everyone is welcome to attend whether or not you have read the selected book for that meeting. This is a drop-in event, and February 12 is our first book club meeting in 2026. We gather in person at the Fairfax Library for this conversation.We will be discussing our selection: On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous by Ocean Vuong On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous is a letter from a son to a mother who cannot read. Written when the speaker, Little Dog, is in his late twenties, the letter unearths a family's history that began before he was born -- a history whose epicenter is rooted in Vietnam -- and serves as a doorway into parts of his life his mother has never known, all of it leading to an unforgettable revelation. At once a witness to the fraught yet undeniable love between a single mother and her son, it is also a brutally honest exploration of race, class, and masculinity.

      "description": "Dr. Lindsey Stewart’s The Conjuring of America traces 400 years of Black women’s magic through the lives of enslaved Mammies, Voodoo Queens, Blues Women, Granny Midwives, and textile weavers who preserved their spiritual practices in secrecy across generations. Stewart shows how conjure has shaped everyday American life, influencing everything from traditional medicines that inspired products like Vicks VapoRub to cultural touchstones such as The Little Mermaid and even the origins of blue jeans. Drawing on letters from the enslaved and the lore of Oshun and other African mystics, Stewart reveals how conjure persisted despite being regulated and outlawed from the moment Africans arrived in America. Her book serves as a tribute to the herbs, food, textiles, song, and dance Black women used to nurture resistance, freedom, and hope.This program is part of Santa Clara County Library District's celebration of Silicon Valley Reads. --- The free, virtual series is open to the public and takes place two to three times a month.

This title should be on shelves and ready to borrow approximately 5 weeks prior to the discussion date. Check with a staff member if you have questions on how to access a copy.Book Description\"A dazzling debut that asks: Can a name shape the course of a life? In the wake of an enormous, history-making storm, Cora sets off with her nine-year-old daughter, Maia, to register her son's birth. Her husband Gordon, a local doctor, respected in the community but a terrifying and controlling presence at home, intends for her to follow his family tradition going back generations, and name the child Gordon. But on the journey there, Cora wonders if it's right to impose the burden of this name and its legacy onto her tiny newborn son. She herself has Julian in mind, and Maia offers up her own suggestion: Bear. What follows are three alternate and alternating versions of both Cora's life and her young son's life shaped by her brave, last-minute choice of name. Spanning thirty-five years, the novel draws us in from the first page, as we follow three unforgettable journeys of one young man, but also his mother, grandmother, and sister. In richly layered prose, The Names explores the painful ripple effects of domestic abuse, the messy ties of family, and the possibilities of autonomy and healing.\"--Provided by publisher.",

Whether you loved it, loathed it, or left it unfinished, we want to hear your take. Come share your impressions and connect with fellow readers! This week we will be reading A Psalm for the Wild Built by Becky Chambers.It's been centuries since the robots of Panga gained self-awareness and laid down their tools; centuries since they wandered, en masse, into the wilderness, never to be seen again; centuries since they faded into myth and urban legend. One day, the life of a tea monk is up-ended by the arrival of a robot, there to honor the old promise of checking in. The robot cannot go back until the question of \"What do people need?\" is answered. But the answer to that question depends on who you ask, and how. They're going to need to ask it a lot.",

Who the skeleton was and how it got there were two of the long-held secrets kept by the residents of Chicken Hill, the dilapidated neighborhood where immigrant Jews and African Americans lived side by side and shared ambitions and sorrows. Chicken Hill was where Moshe and Chona Ludlow lived when Moshe integrated his theater and where Chona ran the Heaven & Earth Grocery Store. When the state came looking for a deaf boy to institutionalize him, it was Chona and Nate Timblin, the Black janitor at Moshe’s theater and the unofficial leader of the Black community on Chicken Hill, who worked together to keep the boy safe. ---With The Friends of the Saint Paul Public Library, moderator Jeff Kamin brings his unique take on a public book club show to Saint Paul. Even if you don’t like the featured book, he “guarantees a good time at our entertaining discussions.” All are welcome to try this moderated reinvention of the book club.",

      "description": "The Civic Center Library's Afternoon Book Club will meet in person on Thursday, February 19th from 1:00-2:00 to discuss The Heaven & Earth Grocery Store by James McBride. This afternoon book club generally meets on the 3rd Thursday of every month from 1:00-2:00pm. All are welcome to join! Request a copy of the book online or ask at the Info Desk of the Civic Center Library (or call 415-473-6057) for assistance in placing a hold. The Heaven & Earth Grocery Store (book) or The Heaven & Earth Grocery Store (ebook) or The Heaven & Earth Grocery Store (eAudiobook) or The Heaven & Earth Grocery Store (audiobook on CD) or The Heaven & Earth Grocery Store (preloaded audiobook, aka Playaway) or The Heaven & Earth Grocery Store (large print) by James McBride From James McBride, author of Deacon King Kong and The Good Lord Bird, a novel about small-town secrets and the people who keep them. In 1972, when workers in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, were digging the foundations for a new development, the last thing they expected to find was a skeleton at the bottom of a well. Who the skeleton was and how it got there were two of the long-held secrets kept by the residents of Chicken Hill, the dilapidated neighborhood where immigrant Jews and African Americans lived side by side and shared ambitions and sorrows. Chicken Hill was where Moshe and Chona Ludlow lived when Moshe integrated his theater and where Chona ran the Heaven & Earth Grocery Store. When the state came looking for a deaf boy to institutionalize him, it was Chona and Nate Timblin, the Black janitor at Moshe’s theater and the unofficial leader of the Black community on Chicken Hill, who worked together to keep the boy safe.As these characters’ stories overlap and deepen, it becomes clear how much the people who live on the margins of white, Christian America struggle and what they must do to survive. When the truth is finally revealed about what happened on Chicken Hill and the part the town’s white establishment played in it, McBride shows us that even in dark times, it is love and community—heaven and earth—that sustain us. - adapted from the publisher ADA Accommodation Request | Solicitud de Adaptación ADA",

This title should be on shelves and ready to borrow approximately 5 weeks prior to the discussion date. Check with a staff member if you have questions on how to access a copy.Book Description\"In a near-future Kolkata beset by flooding and blight, Ma, her two year old daughter Mishti, and her elderly father Dadu are just days from leaving the collapsing city behind to join Ma's husband in the home he has been building for them in Ann Arbor, Michigan. After procuring long-awaited passports and visas from the consulate, they pack their bags for the flight to America. But in the morning they awaken to discover that Ma's purse, with all the treasured documents within it, has been stolen. A Guardian and a Thief tells two stories: the story of Ma and her family, their struggle to emigrate to America, and their devastation in the wake of the theft that changes their fate to one of implacable tragedy; and Boomba, the thief, whose hunger and desperation to care for his family drive him to commit a crime whose consequences he cannot fathom. With stunning control and command, Megha Majumdar paints a kaleidoscopic portrait of two families whose destinies become inexorably entangled, wresting compassion from each narrative as the complexities of each character's circumstances-their helplessness in the face of poverty and corruption, and the need to stave off encroaching catastrophe--are captured with clarity and piercing empathy. A masterful new work from one of the most exciting voices of her generation\"--Provided by publisher.",

We'll feature different titles and authors each month. Come and share your impressions, thoughts and interpretations of a book we have all read. This month we are reading Monsters: A Fan's Dilemma by Claire Dederer.In this unflinching, deeply personal book that expands on her instantly viral Paris Review essay, \"What Do We Do With the Art of Monstrous Men?\" Claire Dederer asks: Can we love the work of Hemingway, Polanski, Naipaul, Miles Davis, or Picasso? Should we love it? Does genius deserve special dispensation? Is male monstrosity the same as female monstrosity? Does art have a mandate to depict the darker elements of the psyche? And what happens if the artist stares too long into the abyss? She explores the audience's relationship with artists from Woody Allen to Michael Jackson, asking: How do we balance our undeniable sense of moral outrage with our equally undeniable love of the work? In a more troubling vein, she wonders if an artist needs to be a monster in order to create something great. And if an artist is also a mother, does one identity inexorably, and fatally, interrupt the other? Highly topical, morally wise, honest to the core, Monsters is certain to incite a conversation about whether and how we can separate artists from their art.",

The Murderbot Diaries Vol 1 description:On a distant planet, a team of scientists are conducting surface tests, shadowed by their Company-supplied ‘droid ― a self-aware SecUnit that has hacked its own governor module, and refers to itself (though never out loud) as “Murderbot.” Scornful of humans, all it really wants is to be left alone long enough to figure out who it is (and to watch its favorite show in its downtime.) But when a neighboring mission goes dark, it’s up to the scientists and Murderbot to get to the truth.",

To celebrate the exhibit, the History Center has partnered with the Saint Paul Public Library to host a book club featuring Precious and Adored by Lizzie Ehrenhalt and Tilly Laskey. Precious and Adored highlights the correspondence between Rose Cleveland, sister of President Grover Cleveland, and Evangeline Simpson, a wealthy widow who would become the second wife of Henry Whipple, Minnesota's Episcopal bishop. The women corresponded across states and continents, discussing their advocacy and humanitarian work - and demonstrating their sexual attraction, romance, and partnership. Participate in the book club to learn more about this portrayal of nineteenth-century LGBTQ history, then visit “The Stories We Keep” to see original letters from the MNHS collections. Participation in this book club includes a copy of the book and two free passes to the Minnesota History Center to see the exhibit. This book club is for adults.",

From the Publisher: This is a tale of murder.Or maybe that’s not quite true. At its heart, it’s a love story, isn’t it?Lana Farrar is a reclusive ex–movie star and one of the most famous women in the world. Every year, she invites her closest friends to escape the English weather and spend Easter on her idyllic private Greek island.I tell you this because you may think you know this story. You probably read about it at the time ― it caused a real stir in the tabloids, if you remember. It had all the necessary ingredients for a press sensation: a celebrity; a private island cut off by the wind…and a murder.",

Because the questions that power this book are not only at play in Oakland. Racialized capitalism drives the development of cities, and cities drive the creation of wealth for most Americans through the property they own in them. At the same time, globalization and automation have run a cargo ship through the former raison d'etre for cities: manufacturing things and housing the people who worked in the factories. What are cities becoming when the big money is made inside a screen or manufactured somewhere in Asia? What is a city, and this city, for? And what does Oakland owe to its residents, whether or not they own property?\"The group will discuss The Pacific Circuit over the course of 3 meetings :February 23, 6:30-7:45March 23, 6:30-7:45April 27, 6:30-7:45Registration is not required, but is encouraged so that we can estimate interest, as well as contact you via email with updates prior to the meeting.This group is brought to you by the Fremont Main Library and Compassionate Fremont. We will continue to read and meet to discuss various books on the 4th Monday of every month from February through October 2026. You are not required to attend the entire year.For information about how to get a copy of the book, please contact Jane via email: jcarr@aclibrary.orgWe look forward to meeting you!",

Who the skeleton was and how it got there were two of the long-held secrets kept by the residents of Chicken Hill, the dilapidated neighborhood where immigrant Jews and African Americans lived side by side and shared ambitions and sorrows. Chicken Hill was where Moshe and Chona Ludlow lived when Moshe integrated his theater and where Chona ran the Heaven & Earth Grocery Store. When the state came looking for a deaf boy to institutionalize him, it was Chona and Nate Timblin, the Black janitor at Moshe’s theater and the unofficial leader of the Black community on Chicken Hill, who worked together to keep the boy safe. ---With The Friends of the Saint Paul Public Library, moderator Jeff Kamin brings his unique take on a public book club show to Saint Paul. Even if you don’t like the featured book, he “guarantees a good time at our entertaining discussions.” All are welcome to try this moderated reinvention of the book club.",

This month we will be reading The Ministry of Time by Kaliane Bradley.NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLERA GOOD MORNING AMERICA BOOK CLUB PICK“This summer’s hottest debut.” —Cosmopolitan “Witty, sexy escapist fiction [that] packs a substantial punch...Fresh and thrilling.” —Los Angeles Times “Electric...I loved every second.” —Emily Henry“Utterly winning...Imagine if The Time Traveler’s Wife had an affair with A Gentleman in Moscow...Readers, I envy you: There’s a smart, witty novel in your future.” —Ron Charles, The Washington PostA time travel romance, a spy thriller, a workplace comedy, and an ingenious exploration of the nature of power and the potential for love to change it all: Welcome to The Ministry of Time, the exhilarating debut novel by Kaliane Bradley.In the near future, a civil servant is offered the salary of her dreams and is, shortly afterward, told what project she’ll be working on. A recently established government ministry is gathering “expats” from across history to establish whether time travel is feasible—for the body, but also for the fabric of space-time.She is tasked with working as a “bridge”: living with, assisting, and monitoring the expat known as “1847” or Commander Graham Gore. As far as history is concerned, Commander Gore died on Sir John Franklin’s doomed 1845 expedition to the Arctic, so he’s a little disoriented to be living with an unmarried woman who regularly shows her calves, surrounded by outlandish concepts such as “washing machines,” “Spotify,” and “the collapse of the British Empire.” But with an appetite for discovery, a seven-a-day cigarette habit, and the support of a charming and chaotic cast of fellow expats, he soon adjusts.Over the next year, what the bridge initially thought would be, at best, a horrifically uncomfortable roommate dynamic, evolves into something much deeper. By the time the true shape of the Ministry’s project comes to light, the bridge has fallen haphazardly, fervently in love, with consequences she never could have imagined. Forced to confront the choices that brought them together, the bridge must finally reckon with how—and whether she believes—what she does next can change the future.An exquisitely original and feverishly fun fusion of genres and ideas, The Ministry of Time asks: What does it mean to defy history, when history is living in your house? Kaliane Bradley’s answer is a blazing, unforgettable testament to what we owe each other in a changing world.The book is available for check out at the Kobetich circulation desk. The Kobetich Book Club meets on the last Wednesday of the month. New members are always welcome! Please call Kobetich library staff at 253-280-2921 for assistance with locating or reserving a copy.",

Register today and join us online.February 2026 Selection: The City We Became by N. K. Jemisin Three-time Hugo Award-winning and New York Times bestselling author N.K. Jemisin crafts her most incredible novel yet, a \"glorious\" story of culture, identity, magic, and myths in contemporary New York City. Book one of the Great Cities series. In Manhattan, a young grad student gets off the train and realizes he doesn't remember who he is, where he's from, or even his own name. But he can sense the beating heart of the city, see its history, and feel its power.In the Bronx, a Lenape gallery director discovers strange graffiti scattered throughout the city, so beautiful and powerful it's as if the paint is literally calling to her. In Brooklyn, a politician and mother finds she can hear the songs of her city, pulsing to the beat of her Louboutin heels. And they're not the only ones. Every great city has a soul. Some are ancient as myths, and others are as new and destructive as children. New York? She's got six. The City We Became Speculative Fiction? What's that? Do you like science fiction? That's speculative fiction. Fantasy? OK, that's speculative fiction too. Horror, magical realism, alternate history, slipstream, steampunk, cyberpunk, dystopias, apocalyptic tales, and stories that are just plain weird? Yep. Those are all eligible for our speculative fiction menu!If reading outside the lines of everyday life interests you, we invite you to join our online community as we explore our reading horizons. Other Worlds might be the change of pace you're looking for.",

      "description": "A GENEALOGICAL PROGRAM SPONSORED BY THE ST. TAMMANY GENEALOGICAL SOCIETY (STGS) AND THE ST. TAMMANY PARISH LIBRARY Hybrid Meeting: Program will be offered in-person at the St. Tammany Parish Library’s Causeway Branch in Causeway, LA and as a virtual broadcast for those at home Hibernia is the Latin word for Ireland. Irish immigrants had a huge impact on the culture, history, and prosperity of New Orleans and its environs. Their survival in early times was facilitated by the Hibernian Society, founded in Louisiana in 1818, “for the purpose of affording advice and assistance to such of their distressed and deserving countrymen as may emigrate to this state.” This presentation documents the origins and contributions of Irish organizations in New Orleans between 1818 and today, including the Hibernian Society, the Hibernian Benevolent Association, the Hibernia National Bank, the Hibernia Homestead, the Ancient Order of Hibernians (AOH), the Ladies Auxiliary of the AOH, the Irish Channel St. Patrick’s Marching Club, the Louisiana Hibernian Charity, and Hibernian Park. The common thread in this narrative about Irish heritage organizations is friendship, unity, and Christian charity. You don’t have to be Irish to appreciate this presentation. It’s just in time for St. Patrick’s Day when everyone is Irish! Michael Fitzwilliam’s family roots in New Orleans go back to the early 1800s. He is the current president of the Pearl River County Genealogical Club and is a member of the New Orleans branch of the Ancient Order of Hibernians, an Irish cultural and charitable organization. Michael is an avid local history buff and has written two books: Do You Know How Picayune Got Its Name? and Do You Know How These Places Got Their Names? He has delivered lectures on a number of genealogy and history topics to a variety of organizations. Michael is a Vietnam Veteran who served in the U.S. Army Medical Command in Vietnam and the 4th Infantry Division Administration Company in Colorado. He was employed for over 32 years in accounting and management positions with Gulf Oil and Chevron. Michael holds a B.S. degree from Loyola University in Secondary Education in the teaching fields of social studies and business administration.

Facilitator - Lorelei Sontag Contact: Mattie Ivy Leeds at 415-663-8375 or mattie.ivyleeds@marincounty.gov to register, or for more information. About the Book: Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin\"A modern love story about two childhood friends, Sam, raised by an actress mother in LA's Koreatown, and Sadie, from the wealthy Jewish enclave of Beverly Hills, who reunite as adults to create video games, finding an intimacy in digital worlds that eludes them in their real lives, from the New York Times best-selling author of The Storied Life of A.J. Fikry\"-- adapted from book jacket On a bitter-cold day, in the December of his junior year at Harvard, Sam Masur exits a subway car and sees, amid the hordes of people waiting on the platform, Sadie Green. He calls her name. For a moment, she pretends she hasn't heard him, but then, she turns, and a game begins: a legendary collaboration that will launch them to stardom.These friends, intimates since childhood, borrow money, beg favors, and, before even graduating college, they have created their first blockbuster, Ichigo. Overnight, the world is theirs. Not even twenty-five years old, Sam and Sadie are brilliant, successful, and rich, but these qualities won't protect them from their own creative ambitions or the betrayals of their hearts. Spanning thirty years, from Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Venice Beach, California, and lands in between and far beyond, Gabrielle Zevin's Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow is a dazzling and intricately imagined novel that examines the multifarious nature of identity, disability, failure, the redemptive possibilities in play, and above all, our need to connect: to be loved and to love. Yes, it is a love story, but it is not one you have read before. ADA Accommodation Request | Solicitud de Adaptación ADA",

      "description": "Meet with your neighbors and fellow mystery lovers on the first Tuesday night of each month for a lively discussion of classic and current mysteries. Read this month's selection, drop in and join the fun! For March 3 the club will be discussing The Castro Valley Reads book selection for 2026, Advice for Future Corpses (and Those Who Love Them) by Sallie Tisdale. Tisdale's book isn't built on a conventional plot; instead, it unfolds as a clear-eyed, compassionate exploration of something universal yet often avoided: dying. Drawing from her long experience as a palliative-care nurse, she guides readers through the practical, emotional, and spiritual realities of the end of life. What emerges is not a manual of dread, but an invitation to look directly at mortality with honesty and even tenderness. The magic of this book lies in Tisdale's voice. She moves with ease between intimate stories from the bedside, philosophical reflections, and grounded, often surprising advice. As she explores the fears, confusions, hopes, and small graces that accompany dying, she reveals the complex inner landscapes of patients, caregivers, and loved ones alike. Her writing is at once candid, lyrical, funny, and deeply humane. Through these interwoven perspectives, we're offered not just practical wisdom but a rare kind of companionship on a topic many of us struggle to face. Ultimately, Advice for Future Corpses is about how to meet mortality—with clarity, courage, humility, and love—and, in doing so, how to live more fully.Advice for Future Corpses* and Those Who Love Them Library staff may take photos, videos, or audio recordings at our events. Please tell us if you do not wish to be photographed, video-recorded, or audio-recorded. We will always respect your requests! An ASL (American Sign Language) interpreter or closed captioning can be provided for this program if requested at least seven (7) days in advance.

      "description": "Our book club meets monthly at the library to discuss books set in Oakland and the Bay Area or by Bay Area authors. We select our books from a variety of genres and eras so you’re sure to find something you’re interested in. We’ll get to learn more about our city, meet some neighbors and discuss what we’ve read. This year we’re mostly alternating fiction and non-fiction books. Meetings are the first Tuesday of the month (note the change from 2025!) from 6:30-7:30pm. Come to one discussion, a few or all of them! No pre-registration or commitment is required – all we ask is that you’ve read at least some of the book and are ready to discuss it. Here’s our 2026 schedule: (Quoted descriptions are from the library catalog unless otherwise noted.) January 6, 2026: Sourdough by Robin Sloan (fiction)We’re kicking off the year with a quick read about the very Bay Area intersection of tech and food culture. Lois is an exhausted software engineer who is gifted a very special sourdough starter by her favorite bakers when they must flee the country. Pretty soon she’s part of a mysterious underground food scene at the former Alameda Naval Air Station. February 3, 2026: Family Style: Memories of An American From Vietnam by Thien Pham (graphic memoir)The book that got the most votes from our members on our year-end poll! “Told through the lens of meaningful food and meals, this graphic novel chronicles the author’s childhood immigration to America, where food takes on new meaning as he and his family search for belonging, for happiness and for the American dream.” Pham is a graphic novelist, comic artist and educator based in Oakland. March 3, 2026: Deep Care: The Radical Activists Who Provided Abortions, Defied the Law, and Fought to Keep Clinics Open by Angela Hume (non-fiction)“The story of the radical feminist networks who worked outside the law to defend abortion. Deep Care follows generations of activists and clinicians who orbited the Women’s Choice clinic in Oakland from the early 1970s until 2010, as they worked underground and above ground, in small cells and broad coalitions and across political movements with grit, conviction, and allegiances of great trust to do what they believed needed to be done–despite the law, when required.” April 7, 2026: Moonglow by Michael Chabon (fiction)“A man bears witness to his grandfather’s deathbed confessions, which reveal his family’s long-buried history and his involvement in a mail-order novelty company, World War II and the space program.” Most of it isn’t set in Oakland, but it is the only book on this list that specifically mentions Montclair Library! May 5, 2026: Automatic Noodle by Annalee Newitz (science fiction)Our May read is a slim 163 pages, but packed with interesting ideas. This book is super popular as of December 2025, so you might want to get your hold in early. “In this semicozy tale set in a dystopian near future, robots open their own restaurant, build an unusual found family and achieve personal growth. A few years after the war that led to California’s secession from the United States, four robots awake in the flooded San Francisco takeout place where they were contracted to work.” (Kirkus) “Emboldened by newly granted civil rights from the California government, the bots reboot their lives in classic Bay Area form: by opening a noodle shop…In many ways, Newitz’s near-future San Francisco resembles today’s city, with not-so-subtle nods to AI anxieties, queer identity and the modern-day immigrant experience. It is, in the words of KQED’s Alexis Madrigal, ‘The most San Francisco book that has ever been or could ever have been written.’” (Leah Worthington) (Ebook listed separately) June 2, 2026: Moneyball by Michael Lewis (non-fiction)Baseball season is in full swing, which makes this the perfect time to read Michael Lewis’s nuanced exploration of “how Billy Beene, the general manager of the Oakland Athletics, used a new kind of thinking to build a successful and winning baseball team without spending enormous sums of money.” July 7, 2026: Girls Girls Girls by Shoshana von Blanckensee (fiction)In the summer of 1996, best friends (and secret girlfriends), Hannah and Sam drive from “New York, to the fabled queer paradise of San Francisco, free from the harsh gazes of their neighbors and the stifling demands of Hannah’s devout Orthodox Jewish mother. In San Francisco, they will finally be together as a real couple, out in the open, around other queer people.” But soon they’re working at a strip club, meeting new people and trying to figure out who just they are. August 4, 2026: Power Hungry: Women of the Black Panther Party and Freedom Summer and Their Fight to Feed a Movement by Suzanne Cope (non-fiction)Journey back with us to the summer of 1969 with the story of the free breakfast movement, grocery giveaways and other nurturing mutual aid programs started by the Black Panthers. “NYU writing professor Cope rescues two female activists from obscurity in this intriguing look at the role that food played in the civil rights and Black Power movements.” If you read One Crazy Summer with us in 2025, you’ll enjoy learning the backstory to the Panthers’ food program. September 1, 2026: Kasher in the Rye by Moshe Kasher (memoir)Go back to school with this “hilarious memoir about the absurdity of addiction.” “When he was a young boy, Kasher’s mother took him on a vacation to the West Coast. Well it was more like an abduction…They moved to Oakland, California. That’s where the real fun begins, in the war zone of Oakland Public Schools. Those early years read like part Augusten Burroughs, part David Sedaris, with a touch of Jim Carrol….Brutally honest and laugh-out-loud funny, Kasher…finds humor in even the most horrifying situations.” October 6, 2026: 107 Days by Kamala Harris (memoir)Hopefully by October the miles-long hold list for this book will have settled down enough for you to get a copy! “For the first time, and with surprising and revealing insights, Kamala Harris tells the story of one of the wildest and most consequential presidential campaigns in American history.” (NPR) November 3, 2026: The Giveaway: The Clay Blackburn Story by Owen Hill (crime fiction)We have something noir-ish by an Oakland author for those long November nights. “Hill’s crime fiction is whip-smart, stylish, subversive, hilarious and just dripping with East Bay color, culture and landmarks. Sweet and sour like a perfect Negroni, Hill has invented a new kind of East Bay Noir — the fog rolls in late, the golden afternoon glow somehow both luxurious and ominous in the class war that never sleeps.” (Recommendation from Tally Ho! Books via Oaklandside) December 1, 2026: Sign My Name to Freedom by Betty Reid Soskin (memoir)Reid Soskin, famous for being the oldest park ranger in the history of the National Park Service while working at the Rosie the Riveter National Park in Richmond, has been witness to a wide sweep of American history. She grew up in the Bay Area, raised four kids, ran a record store in Berkeley and more. “Betty just turned 104 and her memoir gives a fascinating look at African Americans migration, the Rosie the Riveter story, and beyond through the Civil Rights era.” (recommender) (Ebook and audiobook listed separately) « See our 2025 books here »« See our 2024 books here »« See our 2023 books here »Learn more about Montclair Library and its Friends group, FOML, here: About | Friends of Montclair Library",

Our members (including some who cannot read) love the way books transport them to different worlds where they meet interesting characters and learn about exciting new things. Taking that journey with a group of friends makes it even more delightful and fun. Join us online (click this link to connect to the virtual book club) Wednesdays 5-6 pm until we reach the end of the book. Estimated end date in March.

The Murderbot Diaries Vol 1 description:On a distant planet, a team of scientists are conducting surface tests, shadowed by their Company-supplied ‘droid ― a self-aware SecUnit that has hacked its own governor module, and refers to itself (though never out loud) as “Murderbot.” Scornful of humans, all it really wants is to be left alone long enough to figure out who it is (and to watch its favorite show in its downtime.) But when a neighboring mission goes dark, it’s up to the scientists and Murderbot to get to the truth.",

Though she yearns for life outside its perfumed halls, she isn't long for a life of drudgery! Using her wits to break a \"curse\" afflicting the imperial heirs, Maomao attracts the attention of the handsome eunuch Jinshi and is promoted to attendant food taster. But Jinshi has other plans for the erstwhile apothecary, and soon Maomao is back to brewing potions and... solving mysteries?!” Rated 13 +",

Participants will be notified by email. Books will also be available to borrow at the library. The Dayton’s Bluff Book Club is a collaboration of the Metropolitan State University Library and the Dayton’s Bluff Branch of Saint Paul Public Library whose members live, work or attend classes on the East Side. We prioritize our selection of titles to those written by Minnesota authors, that have a local setting, or that are written by people of color and other diverse authors. Book discussions usually include issues related to social justice, equity, and anti-racism. We encourage book club members to use both the university and public libraries in pursuit of lifelong learning and the joy of reading. Discussions are frequently facilitated by authors, Metropolitan State faculty, or other guests from the community.

For more information and a Zoom invite, contact Davo Knepler at nuevodavos@yahoo.com.We will be discussing The Last Dekrepitzer by Howard Langer. The author will be joining us for the discussion. WINNER NATIONAL JEWISH BOOK AWARD The fiddler busking in the Columbus Circle subway station in 1965 is the Dekrepitzer Rebbe, the sole survivor of the obscure Dekrepitzer Hasidic sect known before the war for its rebbes' fiddling. The Last Dekrepitzer follows the life and spiritual quest of Shmuel Meir Lichtbencher a/k/a Sam Lightup, from his isolated shtetl in the mountains of southern Poland, where he is brought up to be the future rebbe, to the wharves in Naples, where he jams with Black soldiers waiting to ship home at the end of the war. Dressing him in the uniform and dog tags of an AWOL soldier, they smuggle him home to rural Mississippi. He lives for years among the Blacks, speaks Black English, preaches and plays the blues with the Brown Sugar Ramblers trio. His marriage to a Black woman, Lula Curtin, legal by Jewish law though forbidden under Mississippi law, results in a cross burning that forces them to flee to Manhattan. He plays on the streets of Harlem and Midtown with the Reverend Gary Davis, the great blind guitarist whose mission is saving souls for the next world. Shmuel Meir's devout wife, though she knows herself to be the Dekrepitzer Rebbitzen, is spurned by the Jewish community. Through it all, Shmuel Meir fiddles his prayers in defiance of God. But God gives the Dekrepitzer Rebbe no peace.For more information and a Zoom invite, contact Davo Knepler at nuevodavos@yahoo.com. Everyone is welcome to attend.

      "description": "Point Reyes is known for its organic farms and food, its natural beauty preserved in public parks, its creative communities, and its Instagram-ready attractions. If one looks back in history, the area surrounding Tomales Bay is also notable for the resilience of its Indigenous community, for the creation of the western dairy industry and its technological innovations, for the 1960s rock stars who lived in or frequented the area, and as a superb living example of America’s melting pot, where immigrants settled to find better lives—and succeeded.Dewey’s new book, Point Reyes And Tomales Bay, chronicles the land and people of Point Reyes, Tomales Bay, and the towns that were and still are very different from each other: Olema, Marshall, Point Reyes Station, and Inverness.California historian Dewey Livingston has been fascinated with Marin history since high school, spending the past 55 years exploring and researching his home, especially West Marin. For decades a National Park Service historian specializing in the rural West, and ten years as a MCFL map archivist, he spent the past ten years on a comprehensive history of the Point Reyes area.Sponsored by Friends of the Fairfax Library.

But what does an owl really know? And what do we really know about owls? Some two hundred sixty species of owls exist today, and they reside on every continent except Antarctica, but they are far more difficult to find and study than other birds because they are cryptic, camouflaged, and mostly active at night. Though human fascination with owls goes back centuries, scientists have only recently begun to understand the complex nature of these extraordinary birds.",

This title should be on shelves and ready to borrow approximately 5 weeks prior to the discussion date. Check with a staff member if you have questions on how to access a copy.Book Description: \"A cross-cultural love story set against the dramatic backdrop of the Allied invasion of Europe in WWII. Vancouver, 1942. Josiah Chang arrives in the bustling city ready to serve his country in the war against fascism, but Chinese Canadians are barred from joining the army out of fear they might expect citizenship in return. So, Josiah heads to the shipyard to find work as a riveter, fastening together the ribs and steel plates of Victory ships. One night, Josiah spots Poppy singing at a navy club. Despite their different backgrounds, they fall for each other instantly and begin a starry-eyed romance that lasts until the harsh reality of their situation is made clear. Determined to prove himself, Josiah takes a train to Toronto where he’s finally given the chance to enlist. After volunteering for the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion and jumping into Normandy on D-Day, he must fight through the battlefields of Europe to make it back to the woman he loves. By turns harrowing and exhilarating, The Riveter explores what one man must sacrifice to belong to the only country he has ever called home.\" -- Provided by Publisher",

      "description": "Want to connect with others over the love of reading? Join our book club to discuss Robert Macfarlane's Is a River Alive? This title should be on shelves and ready to borrow approximately 5 weeks prior to the discussion date. Check with a staff member if you have questions on how to access a copy.Book Description\"From the celebrated nature writer, observer and advocate Robert Macfarlane, a brilliant, immersive and paradigm-shifting book that says an emphatic yes to the question it asks. Robert Macfarlane writes, \"At the heart of Is A River Alive? is a single, powerful idea: that rivers, forests, glaciers and mountains are living beings, and that as such they have rights that should be recognized both in imagination and in law. The river has the right to flow unimpeded to the sea; the old-growth forest the right not to be felled; the mountain the right not to be disembowelled for coal.\" This idea -- known as the Rights of Nature -- is driving a conceptual and legal revolution, largely led by Indigenous and non-white activists who are succeeding at challenging the Western legal system to think beyond the idea of nature as material for humans to exploit to a future where regarding all of nature as a living entity may ensure our survival. The book flows like water, from the mountains to the sea, following three major journeys Macfarlane undertakes with local activists: to Ecuador where a recent court decision protects the ancient cedars of the cloud forests from Canadian mining activity; to India, where the fight to revive rivers that start in the glaciers of the Himalayas and empty into the ocean and polluted lagoons of Chennai is not yet won; and to northeastern Quebec where in 2021 an alliance between the local Innu nation and the regional municipal council declared the Mutehekau (Magpie) River a living being, with legal rights. Along with the voices of his fellow travellers, Macfarlane's own voice and incomparable gifts of expression carry immeasurable power to open hearts, spark conversations and challenge perspectives, making Is A River Alive? not only a wondrous literary experience but a powerful rallying cry in the environmental justice movement\"--Provided by publisher.",

This title should be on shelves and ready to borrow approximately 5 weeks prior to the discussion date. Check with a staff member if you have questions on how to access a copy.Book Description\"Beth and her gentle, kind husband Frank are happily married, but their relationship relies on the past staying buried. But when Beth’s brother-in-law shoots a dog going after their sheep, Beth doesn’t realize that the gunshot will alter the course of their lives. For the dog belonged to none other than Gabriel Wolfe, the man Beth loved as a teenager—the man who broke her heart years ago. Gabriel has returned to the village with his young son Leo, a boy who reminds Beth very much of her own son, who died in a tragic accident.As Beth is pulled back into Gabriel’s life, tensions around the village rise and dangerous secrets and jealousies from the past resurface, this time with deadly consequences. Beth is forced to make a choice between the woman she once was, and the woman she has become.A sweeping love story with the pace and twists of a thriller, Broken Country is a novel of simmering passion, impossible choices, and explosive consequences that toggles between the past and present to explore the far-reaching legacy of first love.\" --Provided by publisher.",

      "description": "Join us at Kobetich Branch to discuss a new book each month. This month we will be reading Rough Trade by Katrina Carrasco. Lambda Literary Award Winner, 2025 Finalist for the Edgar Award for Best Novel Named a Best Crime Novel of the Year byThe New York Times and a Best Book of the Year by The New Yorker and AutostraddleAlma Rosales is back and trouble is hot on her heels in this thrilling, queer historical novel from the critically acclaimed author of The Best Bad Things.Washington Territory, 1888. With contacts on the docks and in the railroad and a buyer’s market funneling product their way, ex-detective Alma Rosales and her opium-smuggling crew are making a fortune. They spend their days moving crates and their nights at the Monte Carlo, the center of Tacoma’s queer scene, where skirts and trousers don’t signify and everyone’s free to suit themselves. And Alma, who is living as a hardscrabble stevedore called Jack Camp, knows this most of all.When two local men end up dead, all signs point to the opium trade. A botched effort to disappear the bodies draws the attention of lawmen, and although Alma scrambles to keep them away from her operation, she’s distracted by the surprise appearance of Bess Spencer―an ex-Pinkerton agent and Alma’s first love―after years of silence. Then a handsome young stranger, Ben Velásquez, rolls into town and falls into an affair with one of Alma’s crewmen. When Ben starts asking questions about opium, Alma begins to suspect she has welcomed a spy into her inner circle, and she’s forced to consider how far she’ll go to protect her trade.Katrina Carrasco plunges readers into the vivid, rough-and-tumble world of the late-1800s Pacific Northwest in this genre and gender-blurring novel. Rough Trade follows Carrasco’s critically acclaimed debut, The Best Bad Things, and reimagines queer communities, the turbulent early days of modern media and medicine, and the pleasures―and price―of satisfying desire. The book is available for check out at the Kobetich circulation desk. The Kobetich Book Club meets on the last Wednesday of the month. New members are always welcome! Please call Kobetich library staff at 253-280-2921 for assistance with locating or reserving a copy.",

She soon learns that she is a Rook, a high-ranking member of a secret organization called the Chequy [CHECK-eye] that battles the many supernatural forces at work in Britain. She also discovers that she possesses a rare, potentially deadly supernatural ability of her own. In her quest to uncover which member of the Chequy betrayed her and why, Myfanwy encounters a person with four bodies, an aristocratic woman who can enter her dreams, a secret training facility where children are transformed into deadly fighters, and a conspiracy more vast than she ever could have imagined. \"Adroitly straddles the thin line between fantasy, thriller, and spoof....O'Malley is a nimble writer, effortlessly leaping back and forth between comedy and action.\" — David Pitt, Booklist The Rook Speculative Fiction?

      "description": "Our book club meets monthly at the library to discuss books set in Oakland and the Bay Area or by Bay Area authors. We select our books from a variety of genres and eras so you’re sure to find something you’re interested in. We’ll get to learn more about our city, meet some neighbors and discuss what we’ve read. This year we’re mostly alternating fiction and non-fiction books. Meetings are the first Tuesday of the month (note the change from 2025!) from 6:30-7:30pm. Come to one discussion, a few or all of them! No pre-registration or commitment is required – all we ask is that you’ve read at least some of the book and are ready to discuss it. Here’s our 2026 schedule: (Quoted descriptions are from the library catalog unless otherwise noted.) January 6, 2026: Sourdough by Robin Sloan (fiction)We’re kicking off the year with a quick read about the very Bay Area intersection of tech and food culture. Lois is an exhausted software engineer who is gifted a very special sourdough starter by her favorite bakers when they must flee the country. Pretty soon she’s part of a mysterious underground food scene at the former Alameda Naval Air Station. February 3, 2026: Family Style: Memories of An American From Vietnam by Thien Pham (graphic memoir)The book that got the most votes from our members on our year-end poll! “Told through the lens of meaningful food and meals, this graphic novel chronicles the author’s childhood immigration to America, where food takes on new meaning as he and his family search for belonging, for happiness and for the American dream.” Pham is a graphic novelist, comic artist and educator based in Oakland. March 3, 2026: Deep Care: The Radical Activists Who Provided Abortions, Defied the Law, and Fought to Keep Clinics Open by Angela Hume (non-fiction)“The story of the radical feminist networks who worked outside the law to defend abortion. Deep Care follows generations of activists and clinicians who orbited the Women’s Choice clinic in Oakland from the early 1970s until 2010, as they worked underground and above ground, in small cells and broad coalitions and across political movements with grit, conviction, and allegiances of great trust to do what they believed needed to be done–despite the law, when required.” April 7, 2026: Moonglow by Michael Chabon (fiction)“A man bears witness to his grandfather’s deathbed confessions, which reveal his family’s long-buried history and his involvement in a mail-order novelty company, World War II and the space program.” Most of it isn’t set in Oakland, but it is the only book on this list that specifically mentions Montclair Library! May 5, 2026: Automatic Noodle by Annalee Newitz (science fiction)Our May read is a slim 163 pages, but packed with interesting ideas. This book is super popular as of December 2025, so you might want to get your hold in early. “In this semicozy tale set in a dystopian near future, robots open their own restaurant, build an unusual found family and achieve personal growth. A few years after the war that led to California’s secession from the United States, four robots awake in the flooded San Francisco takeout place where they were contracted to work.” (Kirkus) “Emboldened by newly granted civil rights from the California government, the bots reboot their lives in classic Bay Area form: by opening a noodle shop…In many ways, Newitz’s near-future San Francisco resembles today’s city, with not-so-subtle nods to AI anxieties, queer identity and the modern-day immigrant experience. It is, in the words of KQED’s Alexis Madrigal, ‘The most San Francisco book that has ever been or could ever have been written.’” (Leah Worthington) (Ebook listed separately) June 2, 2026: Moneyball by Michael Lewis (non-fiction)Baseball season is in full swing, which makes this the perfect time to read Michael Lewis’s nuanced exploration of “how Billy Beene, the general manager of the Oakland Athletics, used a new kind of thinking to build a successful and winning baseball team without spending enormous sums of money.” July 7, 2026: Girls Girls Girls by Shoshana von Blanckensee (fiction)In the summer of 1996, best friends (and secret girlfriends), Hannah and Sam drive from “New York, to the fabled queer paradise of San Francisco, free from the harsh gazes of their neighbors and the stifling demands of Hannah’s devout Orthodox Jewish mother. In San Francisco, they will finally be together as a real couple, out in the open, around other queer people.” But soon they’re working at a strip club, meeting new people and trying to figure out who just they are. August 4, 2026: Power Hungry: Women of the Black Panther Party and Freedom Summer and Their Fight to Feed a Movement by Suzanne Cope (non-fiction)Journey back with us to the summer of 1969 with the story of the free breakfast movement, grocery giveaways and other nurturing mutual aid programs started by the Black Panthers. “NYU writing professor Cope rescues two female activists from obscurity in this intriguing look at the role that food played in the civil rights and Black Power movements.” If you read One Crazy Summer with us in 2025, you’ll enjoy learning the backstory to the Panthers’ food program. September 1, 2026: Kasher in the Rye by Moshe Kasher (memoir)Go back to school with this “hilarious memoir about the absurdity of addiction.” “When he was a young boy, Kasher’s mother took him on a vacation to the West Coast. Well it was more like an abduction…They moved to Oakland, California. That’s where the real fun begins, in the war zone of Oakland Public Schools. Those early years read like part Augusten Burroughs, part David Sedaris, with a touch of Jim Carrol….Brutally honest and laugh-out-loud funny, Kasher…finds humor in even the most horrifying situations.” October 6, 2026: 107 Days by Kamala Harris (memoir)Hopefully by October the miles-long hold list for this book will have settled down enough for you to get a copy! “For the first time, and with surprising and revealing insights, Kamala Harris tells the story of one of the wildest and most consequential presidential campaigns in American history.” (NPR) November 3, 2026: The Giveaway: The Clay Blackburn Story by Owen Hill (crime fiction)We have something noir-ish by an Oakland author for those long November nights. “Hill’s crime fiction is whip-smart, stylish, subversive, hilarious and just dripping with East Bay color, culture and landmarks. Sweet and sour like a perfect Negroni, Hill has invented a new kind of East Bay Noir — the fog rolls in late, the golden afternoon glow somehow both luxurious and ominous in the class war that never sleeps.” (Recommendation from Tally Ho! Books via Oaklandside) December 1, 2026: Sign My Name to Freedom by Betty Reid Soskin (memoir)Reid Soskin, famous for being the oldest park ranger in the history of the National Park Service while working at the Rosie the Riveter National Park in Richmond, has been witness to a wide sweep of American history. She grew up in the Bay Area, raised four kids, ran a record store in Berkeley and more. “Betty just turned 104 and her memoir gives a fascinating look at African Americans migration, the Rosie the Riveter story, and beyond through the Civil Rights era.” (recommender) (Ebook and audiobook listed separately) « See our 2025 books here »« See our 2024 books here »« See our 2023 books here »Learn more about Montclair Library and its Friends group, FOML, here: About | Friends of Montclair Library",

But everybody knows magicians are born, not made, and Coco was not born with a gift for magic. Resigned to her un-magical life, Coco is about to give up on her dream to become a witch...until the day she meets Qifrey, a mysterious, traveling magician. After secretly seeing Qifrey perform magic in a way she's never seen before, Coco soon learns what everybody \"knows\" might not be the truth, and discovers that her magical dream may not be as far away as it may seem...” Rated 13 +",

Within the labyrinth of halls an ocean is imprisoned; waves thunder up staircases; rooms are flooded in an instant. But Piranesi is not afraid; he understands the tides as he understands the pattern of the labyrinth itself. He lives to explore the house.But as Piranesi explores, evidence emerges of another person, and a terrible truth begins to unravel, revealing a world beyond the one Piranesi has always known.Copies of Piranesi are available at Main while they last for sign out, or from various branch collections.",

This title should be on shelves and ready to borrow approximately 5 weeks prior to the discussion date.

After procuring long-awaited passports and visas from the consulate, they pack their bags for the flight to America. But in the morning they awaken to discover that Ma's purse, with all the treasured documents within it, has been stolen. A Guardian and a Thief tells two stories: the story of Ma and her family, their struggle to emigrate to America, and their devastation in the wake of the theft that changes their fate to one of implacable tragedy; and Boomba, the thief, whose hunger and desperation to care for his family drive him to commit a crime whose consequences he cannot fathom. With stunning control and command, Megha Majumdar paints a kaleidoscopic portrait of two families whose destinies become inexorably entangled, wresting compassion from each narrative as the complexities of each character's circumstances-their helplessness in the face of poverty and corruption, and the need to stave off encroaching catastrophe--are captured with clarity and piercing empathy. A masterful new work from one of the most exciting voices of her generation\"--Provided by publisher.",

This title should be on shelves and ready to borrow approximately 5 weeks prior to the discussion date. Check with a staff member if you have questions on how to access a copy.Book Description\"A dazzling debut that asks: Can a name shape the course of a life? In the wake of an enormous, history-making storm, Cora sets off with her nine-year-old daughter, Maia, to register her son's birth. Her husband Gordon, a local doctor, respected in the community but a terrifying and controlling presence at home, intends for her to follow his family tradition going back generations, and name the child Gordon. But on the journey there, Cora wonders if it's right to impose the burden of this name and its legacy onto her tiny newborn son. She herself has Julian in mind, and Maia offers up her own suggestion: Bear. What follows are three alternate and alternating versions of both Cora's life and her young son's life shaped by her brave, last-minute choice of name. Spanning thirty-five years, the novel draws us in from the first page, as we follow three unforgettable journeys of one young man, but also his mother, grandmother, and sister. In richly layered prose, The Names explores the painful ripple effects of domestic abuse, the messy ties of family, and the possibilities of autonomy and healing.\"--Provided by publisher.",

Register today and join us online.April 2026 Selection:Ocean's Godori by Elaine U. ChoExciting, fresh and unique perspective science fiction from a rising Seattle writer.Ocean Yoon has never felt very Korean, even if she is descended from a long line of haenyeo, Jeju Island's beloved female divers. She doesn't like soju, constantly misses cultural references, and despite her love of the game, people still say that she doesn't play Hwatu like a Korean. Ocean's also persona non grata at the Alliance, Korea's solar system-dominating space agency, since a mission went awry and she earned a reputation for being a little too quick with her gun. When her best friend, Teo, second son of the Anand Tech empire, is framed for murdering his family, Ocean and her misfit crewmates are pushed to the forefront of a high-stakes ideological conflict. But dodging bullets and winning space chases may be the easiest part of what comes next.“Ocean’s Godori navigates the space lane blazed by Becky Chambers and James S.A. Corey, but it manages to arrive at some exciting new destinations.” — Charlie Jane Anders, Washington PostOcean's Godori Speculative Fiction? What's that? Do you like science fiction?

      "description": "Join us online for an evening with author, Daniel H. Wilson.Wilson is a frequent New York Times bestseller with a long bibliography that spans speculative fiction, techno-thrillers, and science satire. His work is informed by his education and research background, including a Ph.D. in Robotics from Carnegie Mellon University. Early standouts include How to Survive a Robot Uprising (2005) and How to Build a Robot Army (2007), humorous but fact-based guides about the dangers of robotics and Al. Wilson may be best known to many for his documentary-style doomsday novel Robopocalypse (2011) and its sequel Robogenesis (2014). Subsequent work includes The Clockwork Dynasty (2017), an historical fantasy about a secret, immortal race of biological automatons whose existence has quietly shaped human history, and The Andromeda Evolution (2019), an authorized sequel to the Michael Crichton classic The Andromeda Strain. Wilson's latest novel, Hole in the Sky, is an alien encounter story inspired by the author's own Cherokee background. Notes The Seattle Times: \"Wilson reimagines first contact through an Indigenous lens, fusing Cherokee cosmology with cutting-edge science and creeping cosmic horror.\" This event is free.

      "description": "Everyone is welcome to join our online (Zoom) book discussion group on Wednesday May 13, 2026. For more information and a Zoom invite, contact Davo Knepler at nuevodavos@yahoo.com.We will be discussing California Dreaming by Noa Silber. Having grown up on stories of her mother's wild youth in California, Elena Berg relocates from New England to the Bay Area in 2011 for a placement as an English teacher with Teach for America. Once there, she is eager to inspire a love of poetry and literature in her diverse but underprivileged students. Her own grandfather--a Holocaust survivor--was a storyteller and teacher who touched the lives of his students for years to come. Elena's mother followed in his footsteps, leaving behind the hippie lifestyle of her twenties to become a university professor. But Elena quickly finds herself feeling disconnected from teaching, unable to inspire her students, and before long, she grows disillusioned with her career. She transitions to a role in an education technology startup--though she questions her decision, her motivations, and her values. Coming of age between the Occupy and #MeToo movements and against the backdrop of the 2016 election and California's ever-worsening fire season, Elena reckons with California as she imagined it and California as it really is. As she does so, she must also ultimately reconcile the person she envisioned herself to be with the person she actually is. For more information and a Zoom invite, contact Davo Knepler at nuevodavos@yahoo.com. Everyone is welcome to attend.

Please see a staff member for details on borrowing the title. Book Description: In a placid, progressive suburb of Cleveland, everything is planned - from the layout of the winding roads, to the colors of the houses, to the successful lives its residents will go on to lead. And no one embodies this spirit more than Elena Richardson, whose guiding principle is playing by the rules. Enter Mia Warren - an enigmatic artist and single mother - who arrives in this idyllic bubble with her teenaged daughter Pearl, and rents a house from the Richardsons. Soon Mia and Pearl become more than tenants: all four Richardson children are drawn to the mother-daughter pair. But Mia carries with her a mysterious past and a disregard for the status quo that threatens to upend this carefully ordered community. When old family friends of the Richardsons attempt to adopt a Chinese-American baby, a custody battle erupts that dramatically divides the town--and puts Mia and Elena on opposing sides. Suspicious of Mia and her motives, Elena is determined to uncover the secrets in Mia's past. But her obsession will come at unexpected and devastating costs.",

      "description": "Join us to celebrate the love of reading with others in our community! The Lynnwood Library Book Group meets regularly on the second Monday of each month from 6:30-7:45pm. This month's selection is How to Age Disgracefully by Clare Pooley. Books are selected by members of the group and cover a variety of genres. When Lydia takes a job running the Senior Citizens' Social Club three afternoons a week, she assumes she'll be spending her time drinking tea and playing gentle games of cards. The members of the Social Club, however, are not at all what Lydia was expecting. From Art, a failed actor turned kleptomaniac to Daphne, who has been hiding from her dark past for decades to Ruby, a Banksy-style knitter who gets revenge in yarn, these seniors look deceptively benign--but when age makes you invisible, secrets are so much easier to hide. When the city council threatens to sell the doomed community center building, the members of the Social Club join forces with their tiny friends in the daycare next door--as well as the teenaged father of one of the toddlers and a geriatric dog--to save the building. Together, this group's unorthodox methods may actually work, as long as the police don't catch up with them first.View all of Lynnwood Library Book Group's 2026 selections.Contact us with questions Programs & Events FAQs To request a sign language interpreter, complete this online form or contact your local library at least two weeks prior to the library event.

      "description": "Want to connect with others over the love of reading? Join our book club to discuss Anthony Doerr's All the Light We Cannot See. Please see a staff member for details on borrowing the title. Book Description:\"From the highly acclaimed, multiple award-winning Anthony Doerr, a stunningly ambitious and beautiful novel about a blind French girl and a German boy whose paths collide in occupied France as both try to survive the devastation of World War II. Marie Laure lives with her father in Paris within walking distance of the Museum of Natural History where he works as the master of the locks (there are thousands of locks in the museum). When she is six, she goes blind, and her father builds her a model of their neighborhood, every house, every manhole, so she can memorize it with her fingers and navigate the real streets with her feet and cane. When the Germans occupy Paris, father and daughter flee to Saint-Malo on the Brittany coast, where Marie-Laure's agoraphobic great uncle lives in a tall, narrow house by the sea wall. In another world in Germany, an orphan boy, Werner, grows up with his younger sister, Jutta, both enchanted by a crude radio Werner finds. He becomes a master at building and fixing radios, a talent that wins him a place at an elite and brutal military academy and, ultimately, makes him a highly specialized tracker of the Resistance. Werner travels through the heart of Hitler Youth to the far-flung outskirts of Russia, and finally into Saint-Malo, where his path converges with Marie-Laure. Doerr's gorgeous combination of soaring imagination with observation is electric. Deftly interweaving the lives of Marie-Laure and Werner, Doerr illuminates the ways, against all odds, people try to be good to one another. Ten years in the writing, All the light we cannot see is his most ambitious and dazzling work\"--Provided by publisher.",
