Bring food related to the book to share.---Based on an Athabascan Indian legend passed along for many generations from mothers to daughters of the upper Yukon River Valley in Alaska, this is the suspenseful, shocking, ultimately inspirational tale of two old women abandoned by their tribe during a brutal winter famine.Though these women have been known to complain more than contribute, they now must either survive on their own or die trying. In simple but vivid detail, Wallis depicts a landscape and way of life that are at once merciless and starkly beautiful. In her old women, she has created two heroines of steely determination whose story of betrayal, friendship, community, and forgiveness \"speaks straight to the heart with clarity, sweetness, and wisdom\" (Ursula K. Le Guin).",

Instead of marriage, Jacquotte dreams of joining the seafarers and smugglers whose tall-masted ships cluster in the turquoise waters around Tortuga. In Haiti she becomes Jacques, a dockworker, earning the respect of those around her while hiding her gender. Jacquotte discovers that secret identities are fairly common in the chaotic world of seafaring, which is full of outsiders and misfits.

For the next twenty years, Jacquotte raids the Caribbean, making enemies and amassing a fortune in stolen gold. When her fellow pirates decide to increase their profits by entering the slave trade, Jacquotte turns away from piracy and the pursuit of riches.

The Caribbean Sea, 1675. Jacquotte Delahaye is the mixed-race daughter of a wealthy tavern owner on the island of Tortuga. Instead of marriage, Jacquotte dreams of joining the seafarers and smugglers whose tall-masted ships cluster in the turquoise waters around Tortuga. In Haiti she becomes Jacques, a dockworker, earning the respect of those around her while hiding her gender. Jacquotte discovers that secret identities are fairly common in the chaotic world of seafaring, which is full of outsiders and misfits. As Jacques, Jacquotte falls in love with Lizzôa d'Erville, a beautiful courtesan who deals in secrets and sex. While others see their work clothes as a disguise, Lizzôa’s true self is as a woman. For the next twenty years, Jacquotte raids the Caribbean, making enemies and amassing a fortune in stolen gold. When her fellow pirates decide to increase their profits by entering the slave trade, Jacquotte turns away from piracy and the pursuit of riches. Risking her life in one deadly skirmish after another, she instead begins to plot a war of liberation. Don’t miss out on this exciting discussion!

      "description": "Vanessa Riley delves into Fire Sword and Sea, her newest novel inspired by the legendary pirate Jacquotte Delahaye. Set in the Caribbean of 1675, the story follows Jacquotte as she rejects the life expected of her and disguises herself as “Jacques,” a dockworker who earns respect while concealing her identity.

About Our Book Club: Each week, an AAC user hosts our sessions, and a librarian reads our story. After each reading, we enjoy an activity or game connected to the book, celebrating representation, creativity, and the many wonderful ways people communicate. We celebrate all forms of communication—AAC, speech, gestures, and expressions—and follow a Floortime-inspired approach that centers on meeting readers where they are and building joyful shared experiences. When applicable, a visual schedule will be emailed 24 hours before each session to help our readers follow along.

      "description": "This month we will be discussing \"Our Missing Hearts\" by Celeste Ng. About the book:From the number one bestselling author of Little Fires Everywhere, a deeply suspenseful and heartrending novel about the unbreakable love between a mother and child in a society consumed by fear Twelve-year-old Bird Gardner lives a quiet existence with his loving but broken father, a former linguist who now shelves books in a university library. Bird knows to not ask too many questions, stand out too much, or stray too far. For a decade, their lives have been governed by laws written to preserve “American culture” in the wake of years of economic instability and violence. To keep the peace and restore prosperity, the authorities are now allowed to relocate children of dissidents, especially those of Asian origin, and libraries have been forced to remove books seen as unpatriotic—including the work of Bird’s mother, Margaret, a Chinese American poet who left the family when he was nine years old. Bird has grown up disavowing his mother and her poems; he doesn’t know her work or what happened to her, and he knows he shouldn’t wonder. But when he receives a mysterious letter containing only a cryptic drawing, he is drawn into a quest to find her. His journey will take him back to the many folktales she poured into his head as a child, through the ranks of an underground network of librarians, into the lives of the children who have been taken, and finally to New York City, where a new act of defiance may be the beginning of much-needed change. Our Missing Hearts is an old story made new, of the ways supposedly civilized communities can pretend to ignore the most searing injustice. It’s a story about the power—and limitations—of art to create change, the lessons and legacies we pass on to our children, and how any of us can survive a broken world with our hearts intact.",

These are the words of the natural world--Dandelion, Otter, Bramble and Acorn, all gone. The rich landscape of wild imagination and wild play is rapidly fading from our children's minds. The Lost Words stands against the disappearance of wild childhood. \" Our discussion will be led by Ayesha Qazi-Lampert, an environmental science teacher at Chicago Public Schools.

This program is provided by Pineville Library Staff and recommended for teens ages 14 to 18 and new adults 18-24. Information about this title:When Prince Xian was a boy, a white snake bit his mother and condemned her to a slow, painful death. The only known cure is an elusive spirit pearl--or an antidote created from the rare white snake itself. Desperate and determined, Xian travels to the city of Changle, where an oracle predicted he would find and capture a white snake. Seven years ago, Zhen, a white snake in the West Lake, consumed a coveted spirit pearl, which gave him special powers--including the ability to change into human form. In Changle, Xian encounters an enigmatic but beautiful stable boy named Zhen. The two are immediately drawn to each other, but Zhen soon realizes that he is the white snake Xian is hunting. As their feelings grow deeper, will the truth about Zhen's identity tear them apart?Looking for the book?

After the film, stick around to discuss your thoughts and ideas with other attendees led by a librarian. This month, King branch is happy to host Raoul Peck's groundbreaking documentary, I Am Not Your Negro, about the work of James Baldwin. I Am Not Your Negro is an examination of racism in America through the lens of James Baldwin’s unfinished book, Remember This House. Combining Baldwin’s manuscript with footage of depictions of African-Americans throughout American history, I Am Not Your Negro uses Baldwins words to illuminate the pervasiveness of American racism and the efforts to curtail it, from the civil rights movement to #BlackLivesMatter. © Velvet Film | 93 minutes | Not Rated Documentary Club is taking place at other branches! Check out hundreds of other screenings at libraries across Chicago. Accessibility English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing will be available for this screening.",

We also welcome allies wanting to expand their bookish horizons. We meet on the first Saturday of the month, with a couple exceptions due to holidays.

In February the book will be Connecting Dots: A Blind Life by Joshua A. Miele with Wendell Jamieson.Blinded as a young boy, Joshua A. Miele's autobiography talks about how he has negotiated life as a blind person in a world created for sighted people. A born problem solver and naturally curious Miele has spent his life not only figuring out how to live a full life, but helping other blind individuals do the same as an advocate for disability and accessibility. He chronicles the evolution of a number of revolutionary accessible technologies and his role in shaping them, including screen readers, tactile maps, and audio description. Along the way, he grappled with drugs and addiction, played bass in a rock band, worked for NASA, became a guerilla activist, and married the love of his life and had two children. The Adult Nonfiction Book Discussion Group meets on the second Sunday of each month at 11 am in Room 201B. All meetings are sponsored by The Friends of the Cupertino LibraryFor accessibility accommodations (ex. ASL), please fill out the online form at sccld.org/accessibility 7+days prior to the event. If you need assistance with the form, speak with a staff member at your local library, call (408) 540-3945, or email us at ask@sccl.org.",

If you'd like to bring a recipe from the book, we can provide plates and utensils to make it a party. This month we are discussion Persian Feasts. When Leila Heller's mother, Nahid Taghinia-Milani came to the United States in 1979, she brought her recipes with her. Persian Feasts features Iranian delicacies in a dazzling tapestry of textures and aromas, from Shiraz in the south to Tabriz in the north. This exquisite collection of 100 dishes includes hearty stews, saffron-infused rice dishes, succulent kebabs, and delicate rosewater desserts – each one telling a story that is steeped in tradition and has been passed down from generation to generation. Unexpected ingredient combinations create distinctive tastes and aromas to every dish – from a simple Herb Frittata to a comforting Eggplant, Walnut & Pomegranate Stew to a delicately perfumed Cardamom and Rose Water Pudding.

      "description": "Enjoy reading manga? Join other teens to discuss stories and characters in our new Manga Monday Club! We will introduce Volume 1 of a series to get you started on your next reading adventure. We encourage teens to read at least Volume 1, whether that is a physical copy from your own manga collection, from our library, or borrowed from a friend. Digital reading also counts; we will be happy to have you participate in our discussion if you have read an e-copy. Physical copies of Volume 1 will be available for in person pick-up at the Enon Branch on a first come, first served basis. Check out Libby and Hoopla for available digital copies. Scheduled for the second Monday of the month. For teens. This month's selection: Fall in Love You False Angels by Coco Uzuki Summary: All sugar, no spice, and everything nice...that's the impression the beautiful first-year high schooler and class president Otogi gives to those around her. One look from the school's \"heartthrob angel\" is all it takes to sweep countless admirers off their feet. But the real Otogi Katsura is no angel: She's calculating, ruthless, and sharp-tongued. When Otogi slips up and exposes her inner baddie in front of the class's other paragon, Toki, he counters by revealing an unexpected side of his own and declaring her his \"partner in crime.\" With cupid's arrow at her back, can the \"heartthrob angel\" maintain her perfect act and regain the upper hand, or will she be the one swept off her feet by a fellow false angel?!” Rated 13 +",

      "description": "The Minnesota History Center is showcasing a number of unique items from the MNHS collections in an exhibit entitled “The Stories We Keep.” This exhibit features 25 objects from MNHS collections—a rich trove built on the generosity and foresight of thousands of people who have entrusted MNHS with their belongings and their stories. To celebrate the exhibit, the History Center has partnered with the Saint Paul Public Library to host a book club featuring Precious and Adored by Lizzie Ehrenhalt and Tilly Laskey. Precious and Adored highlights the correspondence between Rose Cleveland, sister of President Grover Cleveland, and Evangeline Simpson, a wealthy widow who would become the second wife of Henry Whipple, Minnesota's Episcopal bishop. The women corresponded across states and continents, discussing their advocacy and humanitarian work - and demonstrating their sexual attraction, romance, and partnership. Participate in the book club to learn more about this portrayal of nineteenth-century LGBTQ history, then visit “The Stories We Keep” to see original letters from the MNHS collections. Participation in this book club includes a copy of the book and two free passes to the Minnesota History Center to see the exhibit. This book club is for adults.",

      "description": "Join us to celebrate the love of reading with others in our community! This month's selection is Mrs. Dalloway by Virginia Woolf. Heralded as Virginia Woolf's greatest novel, this is a vivid portrait of a single day in a woman's life. When we meet her, Mrs. Clarissa Dalloway is preoccupied with the last-minute details of party preparation while in her mind she is something much more than a perfect society hostess. As she readies her house, she is flooded with remembrances of faraway times. And, met with the realities of the present, Clarissa reexamines the choices that brought her there, hesitantly looking ahead to the unfamiliar work of growing old. Visit the following link to view all of Lynnwood Library Book Group's 2026 selections: Lynnwood Library Book Club 2026 Titles. Books are selected by members of the group and cover a variety of genres. The Lynnwood Library Book Group meets regularly on the second Monday of each month from 6:30-7:45pm.

If your answer is yes to all of the above, sign up for our tween book club to join us for a lively discussion along with a fun activity. This program is for ages 9-12. Registration is required. We will meet in-person in the Spring Branch Memorial Library Meeting Room. Once registered, you will be contacted when a copy of the book is available for pick up. The book we will be reading: Lion Dancers by Cai Tse. Young Wei dreamed of being a legendary lion dancer just like his dad. With his best friend Hung performing as the tail and Wei controlling the head, he knew they could become the next generation of lion dance champions. But after his dad's sudden passing, Wei abruptly quits lion dancing—and his friendship with Hung.Years later, Wei is stuck...in life, in school, and on the bench at games. That is, until he crashes a junior lion dance practice and feels his long-sleeping passion wake up within him once more. The team is happy to have another member to carry on the tradition, especially as one as preternaturally talented as Wei. There's just one person who doesn't want him there: the self-proclaimed star, Hung.As Wei and Hung fight to be considered the top lion dancer, both will have to learn how to face their mistakes head-on and remember what it really means to be part of a team.",

Additional copies of the book available at the YS community library. Book club co-sponsored with the Yellow Springs Community Library. Register for the book club at glenhelen.org.-- All flourishing is mutual”, author Kimmerer begins The Serviceberry. She then leads readers through a poetic, joyful path to the native berry patch and the idea of a gift economy. Kimmerer tells us “the serviceberry shows us another model, one based on reciprocity, where wealth comes from the quality of your relationships, not from the illusions of self-sufficiency.” A lighthearted read interwoven with themes of hope and generosity, defines gifts, whether a basket of juicy serviceberries or physical items, as a part of a moving, reciprocal economy able to bring joy and worthy of our attention.",

      "description": "The Page Turners is an evening book discussion group for adults that meets at the Castro Valley Library on the second Tuesday of the month at 7 pm. Facilitated by librarian Chris Selig, the discussions focus on compelling, well-reviewed fiction and nonfiction books written for adults.For February we will discuss James by Percival Everett, which is available for check out through the Library collection and Link Plus. Synopsis James, is a retelling of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, that is harrowing, ferociously funny and told from the enslaved Jim's point of view. When the enslaved Jim overhears that he is about to be sold to a man in New Orleans, separated from his wife and daughter forever, he decides to hide on nearby Jackson Island until he can formulate a plan. Meanwhile, Huck Finn has faked his own death to escape his violent father, recently returned to town. As all readers of American literature know, thus begins the dangerous and transcendent journey by raft down the Mississippi River toward the elusive and too-often-unreliable promise of the Free States and beyond. While many narrative set pieces of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn remain in place (floods and storms, stumbling across both unexpected death and unexpected treasure in the myriad stopping points along the river's banks, encountering the scam artists posing as the Duke and Dauphin...), Jim's agency, intelligence and compassion are shown in a radically new light.James _________ An ASL (American Sign Language) interpreter can be provided for this program if requested at least seven business days in advance.

      "description": "Join us on the 2nd Wednesday of each month at 3pm for Inquisitive Minds: Nonfiction Book Club! We will meet in the Community Room at SouthPark Regional Library. This month (February) we're discussing: A Wilder Shore: The Romantic Odyssey of Fanny and Robert Louis Stevenson by Camille Peri\"He was an ambitious but drifting writer from a prominent Scottish family. She was a tough Nevada silver miner’s wife, with children, when they met. Who could have predicted that Fanny Van de Grift and Robert Louis Stevenson would go on to create one of history’s great literary marriages?From their first encounter in France in 1876, Fanny and Louis’s partnership transcended societal expectations to become a literary union that was progressive, eccentric, and tempestuous, but always animated by a profound mutual respect. Seeking creative freedom, inspiration, and better health for Louis, who battled chronic illness, they embarked on a whirlwind journey around the world, from the bohemian enclaves of Europe to the shores of Samoa, where they lived and joined the native islanders’ fight for independence from imperialist powers. Amid the currents of their stormy yet deeply loving relationship, Fanny wrote colorful accounts of her life, contributed to Louis’s work and kept him alive to pen classic novels such as Treasure Island, Kidnapped, and The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde that would go on to resonate with generations of readers.A portrait of two extraordinary people and a testament to the power of love to foster the human spirit, A Wilder Shore unfolds with all the richness and complexity of a timeless epic, capturing the resilience, courage, and devotion that sparked some of our most celebrated and enduring literary masterpieces.\" This program will be provided by the SouthPark Regional Library staff.

Our members (including some who cannot read) love the way books transport them to different worlds where they meet interesting characters and learn about exciting new things. Taking that journey with a group of friends makes it even more delightful and fun. Join us online (click this link to connect to the virtual book club) Wednesdays 5-6 pm until we reach the end of the book. Estimated end date in March.

      "description": "Join us on the second Wednesday each month to discuss a fantasy or science fiction book! --- This month's title is Piranesi by Susanna Clarke.From the New York Times bestselling author of Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, an intoxicating, hypnotic new novel set in a dreamlike alternative reality. Piranesi's house is no ordinary building: its rooms are infinite, its corridors endless, its walls are lined with thousands upon thousands of statues, each one different from all the others. Within the labyrinth of halls an ocean is imprisoned; waves thunder up staircases, rooms are flooded in an instant. But Piranesi is not afraid; he understands the tides as he understands the pattern of the labyrinth itself. He lives to explore the house. There is one other person in the house-a man called The Other, who visits Piranesi twice a week and asks for help with research into A Great and Secret Knowledge. But as Piranesi explores, evidence emerges of another person, and a terrible truth begins to unravel, revealing a world beyond the one Piranesi has always known. For readers of Neil Gaiman's The Ocean at the End of the Lane and fans of Madeline Miller's Circe, Piranesi introduces an astonishing new world, an infinite labyrinth, full of startling images and surreal beauty, haunted by the tides and the clouds",

      "description": "Read the World is a book discussion group for youth in 6th to 9th grade. Each month we'll read a book set in a different country then enjoy conversations about the book as well as other cultures and experiences. We'll read from multiple categories, including fiction, nonfiction, graphic novels, novels in verse, and more. This month we'll be reading and discussing Amal Unbound by Aisha Saeed and set in Pakistan. Please register then stop by the library for a free copy of the book no earlier than one month before the discussion.\"Twelve-year-old Amal's dream of becoming a teacher one day is dashed in an instant when she accidentally insults a member of her Pakistani village's ruling family. As punishment for her behavior, she is forced to leave her heartbroken family behind and go work at their estate. Amal is distraught but has faced setbacks before. So she summons her courage and begins navigating the complex rules of life as a servant, with all its attendant jealousies and pecking-order woes. Most troubling, though, is Amal's increasing awareness of the deadly measures the Khan family will go to in order to stay in control. It's clear that their hold over her village will never loosen as long as everyone is too afraid to challenge them--so if Amal is to have any chance of ensuring her loved ones' safety and winning back her freedom, she must find a way to work with the other servants to make it happen.\" Amal Unbound An ASL (American Sign Language) interpreter can be provided for this program if requested at least seven (7) business days in advance.

We meet once a month on a Wednesday in the months of October, November, December, February, March, and April at 6 p.m. We have a limited supply of free books for book club participants that will be available for pick up at the Dayton's Bluff Branch Library when selections become finalized. Participants will be notified by email. Books will also be available to borrow at the library. The Dayton’s Bluff Book Club is a collaboration of the Metropolitan State University Library and the Dayton’s Bluff Branch of Saint Paul Public Library whose members live, work or attend classes on the East Side. We prioritize our selection of titles to those written by Minnesota authors, that have a local setting, or that are written by people of color and other diverse authors. Book discussions usually include issues related to social justice, equity, and anti-racism. We encourage book club members to use both the university and public libraries in pursuit of lifelong learning and the joy of reading. Discussions are frequently facilitated by authors, Metropolitan State faculty, or other guests from the community.

Wednesday, February 11, 2026, 5:30 p.m. Iona Iverson's Rules for Commuting, by Clare Pooley.Nobody ever talks to strangers on the train. It's a rule. But what would happen if they did? From the New York Times bestselling author of The Authenticity Project, a heartwarming novel about unexpected friendships and the joy of connecting. Every day, Iona, a larger-than-life magazine advice columnist, travels the ten stops from Hampton Court to Waterloo Station by train, accompanied by her dog, Lulu. Every day she sees the same people, whom she knows only by nickname: Impossibly-Pretty-Bookworm and Terribly-Lonely-Teenager. Of course, they never speak. Seasoned commuters never do. Then one morning, the man she calls Smart-But-Sexist-Manspreader chokes on a grape right in front of her. He'd have died were it not for the timely intervention of Sanjay, a nurse, who gives him the Heimlich maneuver. This single event starts a chain reaction, and an eclectic group of people with almost nothing in common except their commute discover that a chance encounter can blossom into much more. It turns out that talking to strangers can teach you about the world around you--and even more about yourself. Wednesday, March 11, 2026, 5:30 p.m. \"Downton Shabby,\" by Hopwood DePree.

The crime-solver is an amateur sleuth, who eavesdrops, gathers clues, and uses their native intelligence and knowledge of their community to solve the crime. Cozy mysteries are generally considered “gentle” books and most have no graphic violence. The setting is often a small town full of colorful characters.Series frequently have a prominent thematic element introduced by the detective's job, pet, or hobby.These books are plot and character driven with an emphasis on solving puzzles rather than suspense. Our chosen book with serve as our theme for the meeting, we will talk about other book series with a similar theme as well as the recipes, crafts, and more included in many cozies.",

This mystery book club generally meets on the 2nd Thursday of every month from 11:00-12:00n. All are welcome to join! Request a copy of the book online or ask at the Info Desk of the Civic Center Library (or call 415-473-6057) for assistance in placing a hold. Razorblade Tears (book) or Razorblade Tears (eAudiobook) by S.A. Cosby A Black father. A white father. Two murdered sons. A story of bloody retribution, heartfelt change, and maybe even redemption. Ike Randolph has been out of jail for fifteen years, with not so much as a speeding ticket in all that time. But a Black man with cops at the door knows to be afraid. The last thing he expects to hear is that his son Isiah has been murdered, along with Isiah’s white husband, Derek. Ike had never fully accepted his son but is devastated by his loss. Derek’s father Buddy Lee was almost as ashamed of Derek for being gay as Derek was ashamed of his father's criminal record. Buddy Lee still has contacts in the underworld, though, and he wants to know who killed his boy. Ike and Buddy Lee, two ex-cons with little else in common other than a criminal past and a love for their dead sons, band together in their desperate desire for revenge. In their quest to do better for their sons in death than they did in life, hardened men Ike and Buddy Lee will confront their own prejudices about their sons and each other, as they rain down vengeance upon those who hurt their boys. - adapted from the publisher ADA Accommodation Request | Solicitud de Adaptación ADA",

Everyone is welcome to attend whether or not you have read the selected book for that meeting. This is a drop-in event, and February 12 is our first book club meeting in 2026. We gather in person at the Fairfax Library for this conversation.We will be discussing our selection: On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous by Ocean Vuong On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous is a letter from a son to a mother who cannot read. Written when the speaker, Little Dog, is in his late twenties, the letter unearths a family's history that began before he was born -- a history whose epicenter is rooted in Vietnam -- and serves as a doorway into parts of his life his mother has never known, all of it leading to an unforgettable revelation. At once a witness to the fraught yet undeniable love between a single mother and her son, it is also a brutally honest exploration of race, class, and masculinity.

      "description": "Dr. Lindsey Stewart’s The Conjuring of America traces 400 years of Black women’s magic through the lives of enslaved Mammies, Voodoo Queens, Blues Women, Granny Midwives, and textile weavers who preserved their spiritual practices in secrecy across generations. Stewart shows how conjure has shaped everyday American life, influencing everything from traditional medicines that inspired products like Vicks VapoRub to cultural touchstones such as The Little Mermaid and even the origins of blue jeans. Drawing on letters from the enslaved and the lore of Oshun and other African mystics, Stewart reveals how conjure persisted despite being regulated and outlawed from the moment Africans arrived in America. Her book serves as a tribute to the herbs, food, textiles, song, and dance Black women used to nurture resistance, freedom, and hope.This program is part of Santa Clara County Library District's celebration of Silicon Valley Reads. --- The free, virtual series is open to the public and takes place two to three times a month.

Alice is fanciful, prone to telling tall tales, and absolutely obsessed with dragons! Fairies deliver dragon eggs to a select few, known as Kindreds, but no egg has ever arrived for Alice. While wandering the woods alone, she finds and secretly befriends a mysterious old dragon named Brim. Alice is excited to finally have a dragon friend of her own, but when Brim suddenly falls ill, Alice must set out on a desperate quest to save him. As Alice searches for a cure, she discovers that her connection to dragons is unlike that of any Kindred— but will her new power be enough to save her friend? Let your imagination take flight in this heartfelt story of friendship, family, and learning to love who you are!\"",

Every month we'll read a different romance book and come together to discuss what we loved or hated. Books will range from closed door to explicit and explore a wide variety of subgenres.This month's title is The Perfect Crimes of Marian Hayes by Cat Sebastian. Marian Hayes, the Duchess of Clare, just shot her husband. Of course, the evil, murderous man deserved what was coming to him, but now she must flee to the countryside. Unfortunately, the only person she can ask for help is the charismatic criminal who is blackmailing her--and who she may have left tied up a few hours before... A highwayman, con artist, and all-around cheerful villain, Rob Brooks is no stranger to the wrong side of the law or the right side of anybody's bed. He never meant to fall for the woman whose secrets he promised to keep for the low price of five hundred pounds, but how could he resist someone who led him on a merry chase all over London, left him tied up in a seedy inn, and then arrived covered in her husband's blood and in desperate need of his help? As they flee across the country--stopping to pick pockets, drink to excess, and rescue invalid cats--they discover more true joy and peace than either has felt in ages. But when the truth of Rob's past catches up to him, they must decide if they are willing to reshape their lives in order to forge a future together. Steam Level: 🔥🔥🔥🔥/5The Perfect Crimes of Marian Hayes",

We'll have and array of LGBTQ+ romance novels and recommendations at the ready for anyone able to join us. The Queer Readers' Cafe is sort of like a silent book club, but chatter is OK. Unlike a typical book club, participants can read whatever they want! We’ll create an LGBTQ+ friendly space in our community room for folks to gather, read, and discuss what they’re reading. A selection of queer reading materials will be available to browse and checkout. Light snacks and refreshments will be provided. Sharing and meeting like-minded readers is encouraged, but participants will not be asked to disclose their identities or their reading preferences. While the intention of this program is to highlight books about the LGBTQ+ experience and/or by LGBTQ+ authors, and to create a safe space for patrons identifying as LGBTQ+, we welcome all participants and reading materials.

Each month, we'll discuss an exciting novel from the fantasy and sci-fi genres. —- Join Krista M. at Coffee Hub in Beavercreek to discuss this month's book The Tainted Cup, a novel by Robert Jackson Bennett. A preview:In Daretana's most opulent mansion, a high Imperial officer lies dead--killed, to all appearances, when a tree spontaneously erupted from his body. Even in this canton at the borders of the Empire, where contagions abound and the blood of the Leviathans works strange magical changes, it's a death at once terrifying and impossible. Called in to investigate this mystery is Ana Dolabra, an investigator whose reputation for brilliance is matched only by her eccentricities. At her side is her new assistant, Dinios Kol. Din is an engraver, magically altered to possess a perfect memory. His job is to observe and report, and act as his superior's eyes and ears--quite literally, in this case, as among Ana's quirks are her insistence on wearing a blindfold at all times, and her refusal to step outside the walls of her home. Din is most perplexed by Ana's ravenous appetite for information and her mind's frenzied leaps--not to mention her cheerful disregard for propriety and the apparent joy she takes in scandalizing her young counterpart. Yet as the case unfolds and Ana makes one startling deduction after the next, he finds it hard to deny that she is, indeed, the Empire's greatest detective. As the two close in on a mastermind and uncover a scheme that threatens the safety of the Empire itself, Din realizes he's barely begun to assemble the puzzle that is Ana Dolabra--and wonders how long he'll be able to keep his own secrets safe from her piercing intellect.",

When Roots was first published forty years ago, the book electrified the nation: it received a Pulitzer Prize and was a #1 New York Times bestseller for 22 weeks. In the five decades since then, the story of the young African slave Kunta Kinte and his descendants has lost none of its power to enthrall and provoke. \"Alex Haley's Roots is unquestionably one of the nation's seminal texts.”- Michael Eric Dyson",

      "description": "Join us to discuss parts 5-9 of Homecoming by Kate Morton. --- Adelaide Hills, Christmas Eve, 1959: At the end of a scorching hot day, beside a creek on the grounds of the grand and mysterious mansion, a local delivery man makes a terrible discovery. A police investigation is called and the small town of Tambilla becomes embroiled in one of the most shocking and perplexing murder cases in the history of South Australia.Sixty years later, Jess is a journalist in search of a story. Having lived and worked in London for almost twenty years, she now finds herself laid off from her full-time job and struggling to make ends meet. A phone call out of nowhere summons her back to Sydney, where her beloved grandmother, Nora, who raised Jess when her mother could not, has suffered a fall and been raced to the hospital.Nora has always been a vibrant and strong presence: decisive, encouraging, young despite her years. When Jess visits her in the hospital, she is alarmed to find her grandmother frail and confused. It’s even more alarming to hear from Nora's housekeeper that Nora had been distracted in the weeks before her accident and had fallen on the steps to the attic—the one place Jess was forbidden from playing in when she was small.At loose ends in Nora's house, Jess does some digging of her own. In Nora's bedroom, she discovers a true crime book, chronicling the police investigation into a long-buried tragedy: the Turner Family Tragedy of Christmas Eve, 1959. It is only when Jess skims through the book that she finds a shocking connection between her own family and this once-infamous crime—a crime that has never been resolved satisfactorily. And for a journalist without a story, a cold case might be the best distraction she can find…Copies of the book will be reserved and available at the library and electronic versions can be found on Hoopla or Libby.Registration for this event is encouraged but not required.",

This title should be on shelves and ready to borrow approximately 5 weeks prior to the discussion date. Check with a staff member if you have questions on how to access a copy.Book Description\"A dazzling debut that asks: Can a name shape the course of a life? In the wake of an enormous, history-making storm, Cora sets off with her nine-year-old daughter, Maia, to register her son's birth. Her husband Gordon, a local doctor, respected in the community but a terrifying and controlling presence at home, intends for her to follow his family tradition going back generations, and name the child Gordon. But on the journey there, Cora wonders if it's right to impose the burden of this name and its legacy onto her tiny newborn son. She herself has Julian in mind, and Maia offers up her own suggestion: Bear. What follows are three alternate and alternating versions of both Cora's life and her young son's life shaped by her brave, last-minute choice of name. Spanning thirty-five years, the novel draws us in from the first page, as we follow three unforgettable journeys of one young man, but also his mother, grandmother, and sister. In richly layered prose, The Names explores the painful ripple effects of domestic abuse, the messy ties of family, and the possibilities of autonomy and healing.\"--Provided by publisher.",

Whether you loved it, loathed it, or left it unfinished, we want to hear your take. Come share your impressions and connect with fellow readers! This week we will be reading A Psalm for the Wild Built by Becky Chambers.It's been centuries since the robots of Panga gained self-awareness and laid down their tools; centuries since they wandered, en masse, into the wilderness, never to be seen again; centuries since they faded into myth and urban legend. One day, the life of a tea monk is up-ended by the arrival of a robot, there to honor the old promise of checking in. The robot cannot go back until the question of \"What do people need?\" is answered. But the answer to that question depends on who you ask, and how. They're going to need to ask it a lot.",

Who the skeleton was and how it got there were two of the long-held secrets kept by the residents of Chicken Hill, the dilapidated neighborhood where immigrant Jews and African Americans lived side by side and shared ambitions and sorrows. Chicken Hill was where Moshe and Chona Ludlow lived when Moshe integrated his theater and where Chona ran the Heaven & Earth Grocery Store. When the state came looking for a deaf boy to institutionalize him, it was Chona and Nate Timblin, the Black janitor at Moshe’s theater and the unofficial leader of the Black community on Chicken Hill, who worked together to keep the boy safe. ---With The Friends of the Saint Paul Public Library, moderator Jeff Kamin brings his unique take on a public book club show to Saint Paul. Even if you don’t like the featured book, he “guarantees a good time at our entertaining discussions.” All are welcome to try this moderated reinvention of the book club.",

While this afternoon book club generally meets on the 3rd Thursday of every month from 1:00-2:00pm, occasionally the day &/or the time will change. All are welcome to join! Request a copy of the book online or ask at the Info Desk of the Civic Center Library (or call 415-473-6057) for assistance in placing a hold. The Heaven & Earth Grocery Store (book) or The Heaven & Earth Grocery Store (ebook) or The Heaven & Earth Grocery Store (eAudiobook) or The Heaven & Earth Grocery Store (audiobook on CD) or The Heaven & Earth Grocery Store (preloaded audiobook, aka Playaway) or The Heaven & Earth Grocery Store (large print) by James McBride From James McBride, author of Deacon King Kong and The Good Lord Bird, a novel about small-town secrets and the people who keep them. In 1972, when workers in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, were digging the foundations for a new development, the last thing they expected to find was a skeleton at the bottom of a well. Who the skeleton was and how it got there were two of the long-held secrets kept by the residents of Chicken Hill, the dilapidated neighborhood where immigrant Jews and African Americans lived side by side and shared ambitions and sorrows. Chicken Hill was where Moshe and Chona Ludlow lived when Moshe integrated his theater and where Chona ran the Heaven & Earth Grocery Store. When the state came looking for a deaf boy to institutionalize him, it was Chona and Nate Timblin, the Black janitor at Moshe’s theater and the unofficial leader of the Black community on Chicken Hill, who worked together to keep the boy safe. As these characters’ stories overlap and deepen, it becomes clear how much the people who live on the margins of white, Christian America struggle and what they must do to survive. When the truth is finally revealed about what happened on Chicken Hill and the part the town’s white establishment played in it, McBride shows us that even in dark times, it is love and community—heaven and earth—that sustain us. - adapted from the publisher ADA Accommodation Request | Solicitud de Adaptación ADA",

This title should be on shelves and ready to borrow approximately 5 weeks prior to the discussion date. Check with a staff member if you have questions on how to access a copy.Book Description\"In a near-future Kolkata beset by flooding and blight, Ma, her two year old daughter Mishti, and her elderly father Dadu are just days from leaving the collapsing city behind to join Ma's husband in the home he has been building for them in Ann Arbor, Michigan. After procuring long-awaited passports and visas from the consulate, they pack their bags for the flight to America. But in the morning they awaken to discover that Ma's purse, with all the treasured documents within it, has been stolen. A Guardian and a Thief tells two stories: the story of Ma and her family, their struggle to emigrate to America, and their devastation in the wake of the theft that changes their fate to one of implacable tragedy; and Boomba, the thief, whose hunger and desperation to care for his family drive him to commit a crime whose consequences he cannot fathom. With stunning control and command, Megha Majumdar paints a kaleidoscopic portrait of two families whose destinies become inexorably entangled, wresting compassion from each narrative as the complexities of each character's circumstances-their helplessness in the face of poverty and corruption, and the need to stave off encroaching catastrophe--are captured with clarity and piercing empathy. A masterful new work from one of the most exciting voices of her generation\"--Provided by publisher.",

We'll feature different titles and authors each month. Come and share your impressions, thoughts and interpretations of a book we have all read. This month we are reading Monsters: A Fan's Dilemma by Claire Dederer.In this unflinching, deeply personal book that expands on her instantly viral Paris Review essay, \"What Do We Do With the Art of Monstrous Men?\" Claire Dederer asks: Can we love the work of Hemingway, Polanski, Naipaul, Miles Davis, or Picasso? Should we love it? Does genius deserve special dispensation? Is male monstrosity the same as female monstrosity? Does art have a mandate to depict the darker elements of the psyche? And what happens if the artist stares too long into the abyss? She explores the audience's relationship with artists from Woody Allen to Michael Jackson, asking: How do we balance our undeniable sense of moral outrage with our equally undeniable love of the work? In a more troubling vein, she wonders if an artist needs to be a monster in order to create something great. And if an artist is also a mother, does one identity inexorably, and fatally, interrupt the other? Highly topical, morally wise, honest to the core, Monsters is certain to incite a conversation about whether and how we can separate artists from their art.",

Entering his silver years, Bill turned his attention to writing a 6-book, 2000-page action and adventure series with his then 11-yo daughter. Their books have been downloaded more than 21,000 times.California Writers Club-San Francisco Peninsula Branch members give presentations on the third Thursday of the month for anyone interested in writing.

Whether you loved it, loathed it, or left it unfinished, we want to hear your take. Come share your impressions and connect with fellow readers! This week we will be reading The Melting Queen by Bruce CinnamonSince 1904, when the ice breaks up on the North Saskatchewan River, Edmonton crowns a Melting Queen, a woman who presides over the Melting Day spring carnival and must keep the city's spirits up over the following winter. But this year a genderfluid university dropout called River Runson is named as Melting Queen. River is betrayed by their best friend, and River recalls intrusive memories of past Melting Queens, and vows to change things.",

      "description": "We welcome you to Albany Library’s monthly book club discussion. The club meets every third Saturday to discuss selecting reading materials. Materials selected for reading and discussion are to be determined by the whole club. The group is open to adults as well as teens, and the number of participants is 12. Please consider joining us for this event. Pick of the Month: Anne of Green Gables by Lucy Maud Montgomery Eleven-year-old orphan Anne Shirley has just arrived at Green Gables, and already her guardians want to send her back. First, she’s not the boy the Cuthberts expected. Second, she talks too much. And even with her generous spirit, the redhead’s a trouble magnet. She gets the neighbor drunk and nearly poisons the pastor! Still, despite a rocky start, the fiery Anne wins over her guardians and her new community. She enjoys life at Green Gables, excels in school, and earns a coveted scholarship. But when tragedy hits, Anne must choose between her dreams and the only home she’s ever known. In this beloved coming-of-age story, Lucy Maud Montgomery drew from her own experiences growing up in Canada during the nineteenth century to introduce generations of readers to one of literature’s most original and inspiring characters (Source: Amazon). Remember, this is a safe space where members provide meaningful feedback to all who participate. Seating: First Come Serve Basis. Library staff may take photos, videos, or audio recordings at our events. Please tell us if you do not wish to be photographed, video-recorded, or audio-recorded.

      "description": "The Minnesota History Center is showcasing a number of unique items from the MNHS collections in an exhibit entitled “The Stories We Keep.” This exhibit features 25 objects from MNHS collections—a rich trove built on the generosity and foresight of thousands of people who have entrusted MNHS with their belongings and their stories. To celebrate the exhibit, the History Center has partnered with the Saint Paul Public Library to host a book club featuring Precious and Adored by Lizzie Ehrenhalt and Tilly Laskey. Precious and Adored highlights the correspondence between Rose Cleveland, sister of President Grover Cleveland, and Evangeline Simpson, a wealthy widow who would become the second wife of Henry Whipple, Minnesota's Episcopal bishop. The women corresponded across states and continents, discussing their advocacy and humanitarian work - and demonstrating their sexual attraction, romance, and partnership. Participate in the book club to learn more about this portrayal of nineteenth-century LGBTQ history, then visit “The Stories We Keep” to see original letters from the MNHS collections. This book club is for adults.",

      "description": "Love reading? Love to talk about books you've read? Join our book club for spirited discussions on a wide range of fiction and non-fiction. Each month we'll tackle a new title. Whether you loved it, loathed it, or left it unfinished, we want to hear your take. Come share your impressions and connect with fellow readers! This week we will be reading Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine by Gail Honeyman.\"Eleanor Oliphant struggles with appropriate social skills and tends to say exactly what she's thinking...and that, combined with her unusual appearance (scarred cheek, a tendency to wear the same clothes year after year), means that Eleanor has become a bit of a loner. But she thinks that nothing really important is missing in her carefully timetabled life of avoiding perplexing social interactions, where weekends are punctuated by frozen pizza, Glenn's Vodka, and phone chats with \"Mummy.\" But everything changes when Eleanor meets Raymond, the bumbling and sweet IT guy from her office. When she and Raymond together save Sammy, an elderly gentleman who has fallen on the sidewalk, the three become the kind of friends who rescue one another from the lives of isolation they have each been living.\"",

From the Publisher: This is a tale of murder.Or maybe that’s not quite true. At its heart, it’s a love story, isn’t it?Lana Farrar is a reclusive ex–movie star and one of the most famous women in the world. Every year, she invites her closest friends to escape the English weather and spend Easter on her idyllic private Greek island.I tell you this because you may think you know this story. You probably read about it at the time ― it caused a real stir in the tabloids, if you remember. It had all the necessary ingredients for a press sensation: a celebrity; a private island cut off by the wind…and a murder.",

Because the questions that power this book are not only at play in Oakland. Racialized capitalism drives the development of cities, and cities drive the creation of wealth for most Americans through the property they own in them. At the same time, globalization and automation have run a cargo ship through the former raison d'etre for cities: manufacturing things and housing the people who worked in the factories. What are cities becoming when the big money is made inside a screen or manufactured somewhere in Asia? What is a city, and this city, for? And what does Oakland owe to its residents, whether or not they own property?\"The group will discuss The Pacific Circuit over the course of 3 meetings :February 23, 6:30-7:45March 23, 6:30-7:45April 27, 6:30-7:45Registration is not required, but is encouraged so that we can estimate interest, as well as contact you via email with updates prior to the meeting.This group is brought to you by the Fremont Main Library and Compassionate Fremont. We will continue to read and meet to discuss various books on the 4th Monday of every month from February through October 2026. You are not required to attend the entire year.For information about how to get a copy of the book, please contact Jane via email: jcarr@aclibrary.orgWe look forward to meeting you!",

Who the skeleton was and how it got there were two of the long-held secrets kept by the residents of Chicken Hill, the dilapidated neighborhood where immigrant Jews and African Americans lived side by side and shared ambitions and sorrows. Chicken Hill was where Moshe and Chona Ludlow lived when Moshe integrated his theater and where Chona ran the Heaven & Earth Grocery Store. When the state came looking for a deaf boy to institutionalize him, it was Chona and Nate Timblin, the Black janitor at Moshe’s theater and the unofficial leader of the Black community on Chicken Hill, who worked together to keep the boy safe. ---With The Friends of the Saint Paul Public Library, moderator Jeff Kamin brings his unique take on a public book club show to Saint Paul. Even if you don’t like the featured book, he “guarantees a good time at our entertaining discussions.” All are welcome to try this moderated reinvention of the book club.",

Since the fall of 2016, Saint Paul Public Library has been a Next Chapter Book Club affiliate. Next Chapter Book Club offers community-based book clubs for adolescents and adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Our members (including some who cannot read) love the way books transport them to different worlds where they meet interesting characters and learn about exciting new things. Taking that journey with a group of friends makes it even more delightful and fun. Join us online (click this link to connect to the virtual book club) Wednesdays 5-6 pm until we reach the end of the book. Estimated end date in March. Contact Erin at erin.zolotukhin-ridgway@ci.stpaul.mn.us with questions. This book will be shared online during book club.",

This month we will be reading The Ministry of Time by Kaliane Bradley.NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLERA GOOD MORNING AMERICA BOOK CLUB PICK“This summer’s hottest debut.” —Cosmopolitan “Witty, sexy escapist fiction [that] packs a substantial punch...Fresh and thrilling.” —Los Angeles Times “Electric...I loved every second.” —Emily Henry“Utterly winning...Imagine if The Time Traveler’s Wife had an affair with A Gentleman in Moscow...Readers, I envy you: There’s a smart, witty novel in your future.” —Ron Charles, The Washington PostA time travel romance, a spy thriller, a workplace comedy, and an ingenious exploration of the nature of power and the potential for love to change it all: Welcome to The Ministry of Time, the exhilarating debut novel by Kaliane Bradley.In the near future, a civil servant is offered the salary of her dreams and is, shortly afterward, told what project she’ll be working on. A recently established government ministry is gathering “expats” from across history to establish whether time travel is feasible—for the body, but also for the fabric of space-time.She is tasked with working as a “bridge”: living with, assisting, and monitoring the expat known as “1847” or Commander Graham Gore. As far as history is concerned, Commander Gore died on Sir John Franklin’s doomed 1845 expedition to the Arctic, so he’s a little disoriented to be living with an unmarried woman who regularly shows her calves, surrounded by outlandish concepts such as “washing machines,” “Spotify,” and “the collapse of the British Empire.” But with an appetite for discovery, a seven-a-day cigarette habit, and the support of a charming and chaotic cast of fellow expats, he soon adjusts.Over the next year, what the bridge initially thought would be, at best, a horrifically uncomfortable roommate dynamic, evolves into something much deeper. By the time the true shape of the Ministry’s project comes to light, the bridge has fallen haphazardly, fervently in love, with consequences she never could have imagined. Forced to confront the choices that brought them together, the bridge must finally reckon with how—and whether she believes—what she does next can change the future.An exquisitely original and feverishly fun fusion of genres and ideas, The Ministry of Time asks: What does it mean to defy history, when history is living in your house?

We'll feature different titles and authors each month. Come and share your impressions, thoughts and interpretations of a book we have all read.This month we will be reading Molly of the Mall by Heidi L.M. Jacobs.Aspiring novelist Molly MacGregor's life is strikingly different from a literary heroine's. Named for one of literature's least romantic protagonists, Moll Flanders, Molly lives in Edmonton, a city she finds irredeemably unromantic, where she writes university term papers instead of novels, and sells shoes in the Largest Mall on Earth. There she seeks the other half of her young life's own matched pair. Delightfully whimsical, Heidi L.M. Jacobs's Molly of the Mall: Literary Lass and Purveyor of Fine Footwear explores its namesake's love for the written word, love for the wrong men (and the right one), and her complicated love for her city.",

Jemisin crafts her most incredible novel yet, a \"glorious\" story of culture, identity, magic, and myths in contemporary New York City. Book one of the Great Cities series. In Manhattan, a young grad student gets off the train and realizes he doesn't remember who he is, where he's from, or even his own name. But he can sense the beating heart of the city, see its history, and feel its power.In the Bronx, a Lenape gallery director discovers strange graffiti scattered throughout the city, so beautiful and powerful it's as if the paint is literally calling to her. In Brooklyn, a politician and mother finds she can hear the songs of her city, pulsing to the beat of her Louboutin heels. And they're not the only ones. Every great city has a soul. Some are ancient as myths, and others are as new and destructive as children. New York? She's got six. The City We Became Speculative Fiction? What's that? Do you like science fiction? That's speculative fiction. Fantasy? OK, that's speculative fiction too. Horror, magical realism, alternate history, slipstream, steampunk, cyberpunk, dystopias, apocalyptic tales, and stories that are just plain weird? Yep.

We'll feature different titles and authors each month. Join us to share your impressions, thoughts and interpretations of a book we have all read. \"The Annual Migration of Clouds\" by Premee Mohamed SYNOPSIS: In post-climate disaster Alberta, a woman infected with a mysterious parasite must choose whether to pursue a rare opportunity far from home or stay and help rebuild her community.The world is nothing like it once was: climate disasters have wracked the continent, causing food shortages, ending industry, and leaving little behind. Then came Cad, mysterious mind-altering fungi that invade the bodies of the now scattered citizenry. Reid, a young woman who carries this parasite, has been given a chance to get away - to move to one of the last remnants of pre-disaster society - but she can't bring herself to abandon her mother and the community that relies on her.",

      "description": "A GENEALOGICAL PROGRAM SPONSORED BY THE ST. TAMMANY GENEALOGICAL SOCIETY (STGS) AND THE ST. TAMMANY PARISH LIBRARY Hybrid Meeting: Program will be offered in-person at the St. Tammany Parish Library’s Causeway Branch in Causeway, LA and as a virtual broadcast for those at home Hibernia is the Latin word for Ireland. Irish immigrants had a huge impact on the culture, history, and prosperity of New Orleans and its environs. Their survival in early times was facilitated by the Hibernian Society, founded in Louisiana in 1818, “for the purpose of affording advice and assistance to such of their distressed and deserving countrymen as may emigrate to this state.” This presentation documents the origins and contributions of Irish organizations in New Orleans between 1818 and today, including the Hibernian Society, the Hibernian Benevolent Association, the Hibernia National Bank, the Hibernia Homestead, the Ancient Order of Hibernians (AOH), the Ladies Auxiliary of the AOH, the Irish Channel St. Patrick’s Marching Club, the Louisiana Hibernian Charity, and Hibernian Park. The common thread in this narrative about Irish heritage organizations is friendship, unity, and Christian charity. You don’t have to be Irish to appreciate this presentation. It’s just in time for St. Patrick’s Day when everyone is Irish! Michael Fitzwilliam’s family roots in New Orleans go back to the early 1800s. He is the current president of the Pearl River County Genealogical Club and is a member of the New Orleans branch of the Ancient Order of Hibernians, an Irish cultural and charitable organization. Michael is an avid local history buff and has written two books: Do You Know How Picayune Got Its Name? and Do You Know How These Places Got Their Names? He has delivered lectures on a number of genealogy and history topics to a variety of organizations. Michael is a Vietnam Veteran who served in the U.S. Army Medical Command in Vietnam and the 4th Infantry Division Administration Company in Colorado. He was employed for over 32 years in accounting and management positions with Gulf Oil and Chevron. Michael holds a B.S. degree from Loyola University in Secondary Education in the teaching fields of social studies and business administration.

Facilitator - Lorelei Sontag Contact: Mattie Ivy Leeds at 415-663-8375 or mattie.ivyleeds@marincounty.gov to register, or for more information. About the Book: Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin\"A modern love story about two childhood friends, Sam, raised by an actress mother in LA's Koreatown, and Sadie, from the wealthy Jewish enclave of Beverly Hills, who reunite as adults to create video games, finding an intimacy in digital worlds that eludes them in their real lives, from the New York Times best-selling author of The Storied Life of A.J. Fikry\"-- adapted from book jacket On a bitter-cold day, in the December of his junior year at Harvard, Sam Masur exits a subway car and sees, amid the hordes of people waiting on the platform, Sadie Green. He calls her name. For a moment, she pretends she hasn't heard him, but then, she turns, and a game begins: a legendary collaboration that will launch them to stardom.These friends, intimates since childhood, borrow money, beg favors, and, before even graduating college, they have created their first blockbuster, Ichigo. Overnight, the world is theirs. Not even twenty-five years old, Sam and Sadie are brilliant, successful, and rich, but these qualities won't protect them from their own creative ambitions or the betrayals of their hearts. Spanning thirty years, from Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Venice Beach, California, and lands in between and far beyond, Gabrielle Zevin's Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow is a dazzling and intricately imagined novel that examines the multifarious nature of identity, disability, failure, the redemptive possibilities in play, and above all, our need to connect: to be loved and to love. Yes, it is a love story, but it is not one you have read before. ADA Accommodation Request | Solicitud de Adaptación ADA",

For March 3 the club will be discussing The Castro Valley Reads book selection for 2026, Advice for Future Corpses (and Those Who Love Them) by Sallie Tisdale. Tisdale's book isn't built on a conventional plot; instead, it unfolds as a clear-eyed, compassionate exploration of something universal yet often avoided: dying. Drawing from her long experience as a palliative-care nurse, she guides readers through the practical, emotional, and spiritual realities of the end of life. What emerges is not a manual of dread, but an invitation to look directly at mortality with honesty and even tenderness. The magic of this book lies in Tisdale's voice. She moves with ease between intimate stories from the bedside, philosophical reflections, and grounded, often surprising advice. As she explores the fears, confusions, hopes, and small graces that accompany dying, she reveals the complex inner landscapes of patients, caregivers, and loved ones alike. Her writing is at once candid, lyrical, funny, and deeply humane. Through these interwoven perspectives, we're offered not just practical wisdom but a rare kind of companionship on a topic many of us struggle to face. Ultimately, Advice for Future Corpses is about how to meet mortality—with clarity, courage, humility, and love—and, in doing so, how to live more fully.Advice for Future Corpses* and Those Who Love Them Library staff may take photos, videos, or audio recordings at our events. Please tell us if you do not wish to be photographed, video-recorded, or audio-recorded. We will always respect your requests! An ASL (American Sign Language) interpreter or closed captioning can be provided for this program if requested at least seven (7) days in advance. For assistance, please contact your library or accessibility@aclibrary.org.",

      "description": "Our book club meets monthly at the library to discuss books set in Oakland and the Bay Area or by Bay Area authors. We select our books from a variety of genres and eras so you’re sure to find something you’re interested in. We’ll get to learn more about our city, meet some neighbors and discuss what we’ve read. This year we’re mostly alternating fiction and non-fiction books. Meetings are the first Tuesday of the month (note the change from 2025!) from 6:30-7:30pm. Come to one discussion, a few or all of them! No pre-registration or commitment is required – all we ask is that you’ve read at least some of the book and are ready to discuss it. Here’s our 2026 schedule: (Quoted descriptions are from the library catalog unless otherwise noted.) January 6, 2026: Sourdough by Robin Sloan (fiction)We’re kicking off the year with a quick read about the very Bay Area intersection of tech and food culture. Lois is an exhausted software engineer who is gifted a very special sourdough starter by her favorite bakers when they must flee the country. Pretty soon she’s part of a mysterious underground food scene at the former Alameda Naval Air Station. February 3, 2026: Family Style: Memories of An American From Vietnam by Thien Pham (graphic memoir)The book that got the most votes from our members on our year-end poll! “Told through the lens of meaningful food and meals, this graphic novel chronicles the author’s childhood immigration to America, where food takes on new meaning as he and his family search for belonging, for happiness and for the American dream.” Pham is a graphic novelist, comic artist and educator based in Oakland. March 3, 2026: Deep Care: The Radical Activists Who Provided Abortions, Defied the Law, and Fought to Keep Clinics Open by Angela Hume (non-fiction)“The story of the radical feminist networks who worked outside the law to defend abortion. Deep Care follows generations of activists and clinicians who orbited the Women’s Choice clinic in Oakland from the early 1970s until 2010, as they worked underground and above ground, in small cells and broad coalitions and across political movements with grit, conviction, and allegiances of great trust to do what they believed needed to be done–despite the law, when required.” April 7, 2026: Moonglow by Michael Chabon (fiction)“A man bears witness to his grandfather’s deathbed confessions, which reveal his family’s long-buried history and his involvement in a mail-order novelty company, World War II and the space program.” Most of it isn’t set in Oakland, but it is the only book on this list that specifically mentions Montclair Library! May 5, 2026: Automatic Noodle by Annalee Newitz (science fiction)Our May read is a slim 163 pages, but packed with interesting ideas. This book is super popular as of December 2025, so you might want to get your hold in early. “In this semicozy tale set in a dystopian near future, robots open their own restaurant, build an unusual found family and achieve personal growth. A few years after the war that led to California’s secession from the United States, four robots awake in the flooded San Francisco takeout place where they were contracted to work.” (Kirkus) “Emboldened by newly granted civil rights from the California government, the bots reboot their lives in classic Bay Area form: by opening a noodle shop…In many ways, Newitz’s near-future San Francisco resembles today’s city, with not-so-subtle nods to AI anxieties, queer identity and the modern-day immigrant experience. It is, in the words of KQED’s Alexis Madrigal, ‘The most San Francisco book that has ever been or could ever have been written.’” (Leah Worthington) (Ebook listed separately) June 2, 2026: Moneyball by Michael Lewis (non-fiction)Baseball season is in full swing, which makes this the perfect time to read Michael Lewis’s nuanced exploration of “how Billy Beene, the general manager of the Oakland Athletics, used a new kind of thinking to build a successful and winning baseball team without spending enormous sums of money.” July 7, 2026: Girls Girls Girls by Shoshana von Blanckensee (fiction)In the summer of 1996, best friends (and secret girlfriends), Hannah and Sam drive from “New York, to the fabled queer paradise of San Francisco, free from the harsh gazes of their neighbors and the stifling demands of Hannah’s devout Orthodox Jewish mother. In San Francisco, they will finally be together as a real couple, out in the open, around other queer people.” But soon they’re working at a strip club, meeting new people and trying to figure out who just they are. August 4, 2026: Power Hungry: Women of the Black Panther Party and Freedom Summer and Their Fight to Feed a Movement by Suzanne Cope (non-fiction)Journey back with us to the summer of 1969 with the story of the free breakfast movement, grocery giveaways and other nurturing mutual aid programs started by the Black Panthers. “NYU writing professor Cope rescues two female activists from obscurity in this intriguing look at the role that food played in the civil rights and Black Power movements.” If you read One Crazy Summer with us in 2025, you’ll enjoy learning the backstory to the Panthers’ food program. September 1, 2026: Kasher in the Rye by Moshe Kasher (memoir)Go back to school with this “hilarious memoir about the absurdity of addiction.” “When he was a young boy, Kasher’s mother took him on a vacation to the West Coast. Well it was more like an abduction…They moved to Oakland, California. That’s where the real fun begins, in the war zone of Oakland Public Schools. Those early years read like part Augusten Burroughs, part David Sedaris, with a touch of Jim Carrol….Brutally honest and laugh-out-loud funny, Kasher…finds humor in even the most horrifying situations.” October 6, 2026: 107 Days by Kamala Harris (memoir)Hopefully by October the miles-long hold list for this book will have settled down enough for you to get a copy! “For the first time, and with surprising and revealing insights, Kamala Harris tells the story of one of the wildest and most consequential presidential campaigns in American history.” (NPR) November 3, 2026: The Giveaway: The Clay Blackburn Story by Owen Hill (crime fiction)We have something noir-ish by an Oakland author for those long November nights. “Hill’s crime fiction is whip-smart, stylish, subversive, hilarious and just dripping with East Bay color, culture and landmarks. Sweet and sour like a perfect Negroni, Hill has invented a new kind of East Bay Noir — the fog rolls in late, the golden afternoon glow somehow both luxurious and ominous in the class war that never sleeps.” (Recommendation from Tally Ho! Books via Oaklandside) December 1, 2026: Sign My Name to Freedom by Betty Reid Soskin (memoir)Reid Soskin, famous for being the oldest park ranger in the history of the National Park Service while working at the Rosie the Riveter National Park in Richmond, has been witness to a wide sweep of American history. She grew up in the Bay Area, raised four kids, ran a record store in Berkeley and more. “Betty just turned 104 and her memoir gives a fascinating look at African Americans migration, the Rosie the Riveter story, and beyond through the Civil Rights era.” (recommender) (Ebook and audiobook listed separately) « See our 2025 books here »« See our 2024 books here »« See our 2023 books here »Learn more about Montclair Library and its Friends group, FOML, here: About | Friends of Montclair Library",

      "description": "New York Times Best Selling Author Doug TallamyHomegrown National Park Our parks, preserves, and remaining wildlands – no matter how grand in scale – are too small and separated from one another to sustain the native trees, plants, insects, and animals on which our ecosystems depend. We can fix this problem by practicing conservation outside of wildlands, where we live, work, shop, farm, and ranch. Thus, the concept for Homegrown National Park: a national challenge to create diverse ecosystems in our yards, communities, farms, and surrounding lands by reducing lawn, planting native, and removing invasives. The goal of HNP is to create a national movement to restore 20 million acres with natives, an area representing of what is now in lawn, as well as millions more acres in agriculture and woodlots. We are at a critical point where we are losing so many native plant and animal species that our life support systems are in jeopardy. However, if many people make small changes, we can restore healthy ecological networks and weather the changes ahead. Doug Tallamy is the T. A. Baker Professor of Agriculture in the Department of Entomology and Wildlife Ecology at the University of Delaware, where he has authored 118 research publications and has taught insect related courses for 45 years. Chief among his research goals is to better understand the many ways insects interact with plants and how such interactions determine the diversity of animal communities. His books include Bringing Nature Home, The Living Landscape, co-authored with Rick Darke, Nature's Best Hope, a New York Times Best Seller, The Nature of Oaks, winner of the American Horticultural Society’s 2022 book award, and his latest book How Can I Help. In 2021 he cofounded Homegrown National Park with Michelle Alfandari (HomegrownNationalPark.org). His awards include recognition from The Garden Writer’s Association, Audubon, The National Wildlife Federation, Allegheny College, Ecoforesters, The Garden Club of America, The Herb Society, Santa Barbara Botanic Garden, and The American Horticultural Association.",

From the sublime (the faint sound of Mozart as you take your last breath) to the ridiculous (lessons on how to close the sagging jaw of a corpse), Tisdale leads us through the peaks and troughs of death with a calm, wise, and humorous hand. Advice for Future Corpses is more than a how-to manual or a spiritual bible: it is a graceful compilation of honest and intimate anecdotes based on the deaths Tisdale has witnessed in her work and life, as well as stories from cultures, traditions, and literature around the world. Free copies of the book are available while supplies last. The free copies will be distributed beginning Sunday, February 1, at 2 pm at the CV Reads Kick-Off Event. The book is also available in the Library collection.

      "description": "The Page Turners is an evening book discussion group for adults that meets at the Castro Valley Library on the second Tuesday of the month at 7 pm. Facilitated by librarian Chris Selig, the discussions focus on compelling, well-reviewed fiction and nonfiction books written for adults.For March we will discuss the Castro Valley Reads book selection for 2026, Advice for Future Corpses (and Those Who Love Them) by Sallie Tisdale. Tisdale's book isn't built on a conventional plot; instead, it unfolds as a clear-eyed, compassionate exploration of something universal yet often avoided: dying. Drawing from her long experience as a palliative-care nurse, she guides readers through the practical, emotional, and spiritual realities of the end of life. What emerges is not a manual of dread, but an invitation to look directly at mortality with honesty and even tenderness. The magic of this book lies in Tisdale's voice. She moves with ease between intimate stories from the bedside, philosophical reflections, and grounded, often surprising advice. As she explores the fears, confusions, hopes, and small graces that accompany dying, she reveals the complex inner landscapes of patients, caregivers, and loved ones alike. Her writing is at once candid, lyrical, funny, and deeply humane. Through these interwoven perspectives, we're offered not just practical wisdom but a rare kind of companionship on a topic many of us struggle to face. Ultimately, Advice for Future Corpses is about how to meet mortality—with clarity, courage, humility, and love—and, in doing so, how to live more fully.Advice for Future Corpses* and Those Who Love Them _________ An ASL (American Sign Language) interpreter can be provided for this program if requested at least seven business days in advance.

We meet once a month on a Wednesday in the months of October, November, December, February, March, and April at 6 p.m. We have a limited supply of free books for book club participants that will be available for pick up at the Dayton's Bluff Branch Library when selections become finalized. Participants will be notified by email. Books will also be available to borrow at the library. The Dayton’s Bluff Book Club is a collaboration of the Metropolitan State University Library and the Dayton’s Bluff Branch of Saint Paul Public Library whose members live, work or attend classes on the East Side. We prioritize our selection of titles to those written by Minnesota authors, that have a local setting, or that are written by people of color and other diverse authors. Book discussions usually include issues related to social justice, equity, and anti-racism. We encourage book club members to use both the university and public libraries in pursuit of lifelong learning and the joy of reading. Discussions are frequently facilitated by authors, Metropolitan State faculty, or other guests from the community.

      "description": "Everyone is welcome to join our online (Zoom) book discussion group on Wednesday March 11, 2026. For more information and a Zoom invite, contact Davo Knepler at nuevodavos@yahoo.com.We will be discussing The Last Dekrepitzer by Howard Langer. The author will be joining us for the discussion. WINNER NATIONAL JEWISH BOOK AWARD The fiddler busking in the Columbus Circle subway station in 1965 is the Dekrepitzer Rebbe, the sole survivor of the obscure Dekrepitzer Hasidic sect known before the war for its rebbes' fiddling. The Last Dekrepitzer follows the life and spiritual quest of Shmuel Meir Lichtbencher a/k/a Sam Lightup, from his isolated shtetl in the mountains of southern Poland, where he is brought up to be the future rebbe, to the wharves in Naples, where he jams with Black soldiers waiting to ship home at the end of the war. Dressing him in the uniform and dog tags of an AWOL soldier, they smuggle him home to rural Mississippi. He lives for years among the Blacks, speaks Black English, preaches and plays the blues with the Brown Sugar Ramblers trio. His marriage to a Black woman, Lula Curtin, legal by Jewish law though forbidden under Mississippi law, results in a cross burning that forces them to flee to Manhattan. He plays on the streets of Harlem and Midtown with the Reverend Gary Davis, the great blind guitarist whose mission is saving souls for the next world. Shmuel Meir's devout wife, though she knows herself to be the Dekrepitzer Rebbitzen, is spurned by the Jewish community. Through it all, Shmuel Meir fiddles his prayers in defiance of God. But God gives the Dekrepitzer Rebbe no peace.For more information and a Zoom invite, contact Davo Knepler at nuevodavos@yahoo.com. Everyone is welcome to attend.

      "description": "Read the World is a book discussion group for youth in 6th to 9th grade. Each month we'll read a book set in a different country then enjoy conversations about the book as well as other cultures and experiences. We'll read from multiple categories, including fiction, nonfiction, graphic novels, novels in verse, and more. This month we'll be reading and discussing Temple Alley Summer by Sachiko Kashiwaba and set in Japan. Please register then stop by the library for a free copy of the book no earlier than one month before the discussion.One rainy night, Kazu sees a strange figure in a white kimono sneak out of his house--was he dreaming? Did he see a ghost? The next day at school, the very same person is sitting in his class--and all his friends are convinced that the ghost-girl Akari has been their friend for years. If that isn't weird enough, Kazu learns that his house is in the exact location of an ancient temple called Kimyō, which, legend has it, could bring the dead back to life! Kazu sets out to discover what happened to Kimyō Temple and if the rumors of its power are true. His investigation draws the unwanted attention of his neighbor Ms. Minakami and his mysterious new classmate Akari, who is definitely not what she seems. Now, Kazu and Akari must join forces to find and protect the source of the temple's power, before it's too late. Temple Alley Summer An ASL (American Sign Language) interpreter can be provided for this program if requested at least seven (7) business days in advance.

      "description": "Point Reyes is known for its organic farms and food, its natural beauty preserved in public parks, its creative communities, and its Instagram-ready attractions. If one looks back in history, the area surrounding Tomales Bay is also notable for the resilience of its Indigenous community, for the creation of the western dairy industry and its technological innovations, for the 1960s rock stars who lived in or frequented the area, and as a superb living example of America’s melting pot, where immigrants settled to find better lives—and succeeded.Dewey’s new book, Point Reyes And Tomales Bay, chronicles the land and people of Point Reyes, Tomales Bay, and the towns that were and still are very different from each other: Olema, Marshall, Point Reyes Station, and Inverness.California historian Dewey Livingston has been fascinated with Marin history since high school, spending the past 55 years exploring and researching his home, especially West Marin. For decades a National Park Service historian specializing in the rural West, and ten years as a MCFL map archivist, he spent the past ten years on a comprehensive history of the Point Reyes area.Sponsored by Friends of the Fairfax Library.

But what does an owl really know? And what do we really know about owls? Some two hundred sixty species of owls exist today, and they reside on every continent except Antarctica, but they are far more difficult to find and study than other birds because they are cryptic, camouflaged, and mostly active at night. Though human fascination with owls goes back centuries, scientists have only recently begun to understand the complex nature of these extraordinary birds.",

This title should be on shelves and ready to borrow approximately 5 weeks prior to the discussion date. Check with a staff member if you have questions on how to access a copy.Book Description: \"A cross-cultural love story set against the dramatic backdrop of the Allied invasion of Europe in WWII. Vancouver, 1942. Josiah Chang arrives in the bustling city ready to serve his country in the war against fascism, but Chinese Canadians are barred from joining the army out of fear they might expect citizenship in return. So, Josiah heads to the shipyard to find work as a riveter, fastening together the ribs and steel plates of Victory ships. One night, Josiah spots Poppy singing at a navy club. Despite their different backgrounds, they fall for each other instantly and begin a starry-eyed romance that lasts until the harsh reality of their situation is made clear. Determined to prove himself, Josiah takes a train to Toronto where he’s finally given the chance to enlist. After volunteering for the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion and jumping into Normandy on D-Day, he must fight through the battlefields of Europe to make it back to the woman he loves. By turns harrowing and exhilarating, The Riveter explores what one man must sacrifice to belong to the only country he has ever called home.\" -- Provided by Publisher",

      "description": "Want to connect with others over the love of reading? Join our book club to discuss Robert Macfarlane's Is a River Alive? This title should be on shelves and ready to borrow approximately 5 weeks prior to the discussion date. Check with a staff member if you have questions on how to access a copy.Book Description\"From the celebrated nature writer, observer and advocate Robert Macfarlane, a brilliant, immersive and paradigm-shifting book that says an emphatic yes to the question it asks. Robert Macfarlane writes, \"At the heart of Is A River Alive? is a single, powerful idea: that rivers, forests, glaciers and mountains are living beings, and that as such they have rights that should be recognized both in imagination and in law. The river has the right to flow unimpeded to the sea; the old-growth forest the right not to be felled; the mountain the right not to be disembowelled for coal.\" This idea -- known as the Rights of Nature -- is driving a conceptual and legal revolution, largely led by Indigenous and non-white activists who are succeeding at challenging the Western legal system to think beyond the idea of nature as material for humans to exploit to a future where regarding all of nature as a living entity may ensure our survival. The book flows like water, from the mountains to the sea, following three major journeys Macfarlane undertakes with local activists: to Ecuador where a recent court decision protects the ancient cedars of the cloud forests from Canadian mining activity; to India, where the fight to revive rivers that start in the glaciers of the Himalayas and empty into the ocean and polluted lagoons of Chennai is not yet won; and to northeastern Quebec where in 2021 an alliance between the local Innu nation and the regional municipal council declared the Mutehekau (Magpie) River a living being, with legal rights. Along with the voices of his fellow travellers, Macfarlane's own voice and incomparable gifts of expression carry immeasurable power to open hearts, spark conversations and challenge perspectives, making Is A River Alive? not only a wondrous literary experience but a powerful rallying cry in the environmental justice movement\"--Provided by publisher.",

The Murderbot Diaries Vol 1 description:On a distant planet, a team of scientists are conducting surface tests, shadowed by their Company-supplied ‘droid ― a self-aware SecUnit that has hacked its own governor module, and refers to itself (though never out loud) as “Murderbot.” Scornful of humans, all it really wants is to be left alone long enough to figure out who it is (and to watch its favorite show in its downtime.) But when a neighboring mission goes dark, it’s up to the scientists and Murderbot to get to the truth.",

Pick up a copy at the library and come join us! Open to teens and adults. No registration required. As one of the few witches in Britain, Mika Moon knows she has to hide her magic, keep her head down, and stay away from other witches so their powers don’t mingle and draw attention. She’s used to being alone and she follows the rules...with one exception: an online account, where she posts videos \"pretending\" to be a witch. She thinks no one will take it seriously. But someone does. An unexpected message arrives, begging her to travel to the remote and mysterious Nowhere House to teach three young witches how to control their magic.The Fairfax Library SciFi and Fantasy Book Club will meet in-person every other month on a Tuesday evening to discuss a book within the genres of science fiction, fantasy, and/or horror. Everyone is welcome to attend whether or not you have read the selected book for that meeting. ADA Accommodation Request | Solicitud de Adaptación ADA",

This title should be on shelves and ready to borrow approximately 5 weeks prior to the discussion date. Check with a staff member if you have questions on how to access a copy.Book Description\"Beth and her gentle, kind husband Frank are happily married, but their relationship relies on the past staying buried. But when Beth’s brother-in-law shoots a dog going after their sheep, Beth doesn’t realize that the gunshot will alter the course of their lives. For the dog belonged to none other than Gabriel Wolfe, the man Beth loved as a teenager—the man who broke her heart years ago. Gabriel has returned to the village with his young son Leo, a boy who reminds Beth very much of her own son, who died in a tragic accident.As Beth is pulled back into Gabriel’s life, tensions around the village rise and dangerous secrets and jealousies from the past resurface, this time with deadly consequences. Beth is forced to make a choice between the woman she once was, and the woman she has become.A sweeping love story with the pace and twists of a thriller, Broken Country is a novel of simmering passion, impossible choices, and explosive consequences that toggles between the past and present to explore the far-reaching legacy of first love.\" --Provided by publisher.",

      "description": "Join us at Kobetich Branch to discuss a new book each month. This month we will be reading Rough Trade by Katrina Carrasco. Lambda Literary Award Winner, 2025 Finalist for the Edgar Award for Best Novel Named a Best Crime Novel of the Year byThe New York Times and a Best Book of the Year by The New Yorker and AutostraddleAlma Rosales is back and trouble is hot on her heels in this thrilling, queer historical novel from the critically acclaimed author of The Best Bad Things.Washington Territory, 1888. With contacts on the docks and in the railroad and a buyer’s market funneling product their way, ex-detective Alma Rosales and her opium-smuggling crew are making a fortune. They spend their days moving crates and their nights at the Monte Carlo, the center of Tacoma’s queer scene, where skirts and trousers don’t signify and everyone’s free to suit themselves. And Alma, who is living as a hardscrabble stevedore called Jack Camp, knows this most of all.When two local men end up dead, all signs point to the opium trade. A botched effort to disappear the bodies draws the attention of lawmen, and although Alma scrambles to keep them away from her operation, she’s distracted by the surprise appearance of Bess Spencer―an ex-Pinkerton agent and Alma’s first love―after years of silence. Then a handsome young stranger, Ben Velásquez, rolls into town and falls into an affair with one of Alma’s crewmen. When Ben starts asking questions about opium, Alma begins to suspect she has welcomed a spy into her inner circle, and she’s forced to consider how far she’ll go to protect her trade.Katrina Carrasco plunges readers into the vivid, rough-and-tumble world of the late-1800s Pacific Northwest in this genre and gender-blurring novel. Rough Trade follows Carrasco’s critically acclaimed debut, The Best Bad Things, and reimagines queer communities, the turbulent early days of modern media and medicine, and the pleasures―and price―of satisfying desire. The book is available for check out at the Kobetich circulation desk. The Kobetich Book Club meets on the last Wednesday of the month. New members are always welcome! Please call Kobetich library staff at 253-280-2921 for assistance with locating or reserving a copy.",

      "description": "TPL'S ONLINE SPECULATIVE FICTION BOOK GROUP! Regularly meets the last Wednesday of each month via Zoom to discuss intriguing, mind-expanding books from multiple genres. Register today and join us online. March 2026 Selection: The Rook by Daniel O'Malley Book one of the urban fantasy / paranormal thriller series The Rook Files. \"The body you are wearing used to be mine.\" So begins the letter Myfanwy [rhymes with Tiffany] Thomas is holding when she awakes in a London park surrounded by bodies all wearing latex gloves. With no recollection of who she is, Myfanwy must follow the instructions her former self left behind to discover her identity and track down the agents who want to destroy her. She soon learns that she is a Rook, a high-ranking member of a secret organization called the Chequy [CHECK-eye] that battles the many supernatural forces at work in Britain. She also discovers that she possesses a rare, potentially deadly supernatural ability of her own. In her quest to uncover which member of the Chequy betrayed her and why, Myfanwy encounters a person with four bodies, an aristocratic woman who can enter her dreams, a secret training facility where children are transformed into deadly fighters, and a conspiracy more vast than she ever could have imagined. \"Adroitly straddles the thin line between fantasy, thriller, and spoof....O'Malley is a nimble writer, effortlessly leaping back and forth between comedy and action.\" — David Pitt, Booklist The Rook Speculative Fiction? What's that? Do you like science fiction? That's speculative fiction. Fantasy? OK, that's speculative fiction too.

Fraser, who was born and raised in the Pacific Northwest, where smelters belted out poison for decades and a proliferation of serial killers in the 1970s and '80s earned the region the nickname \"America's Killing Fields,\" marries a poignant memoir of her Washington State childhood with a vivid catalog of crimes by Ted Bundy, the Green River Killer, and others.

Come to one discussion, a few or all of them! No pre-registration or commitment is required – all we ask is that you’ve read at least some of the book and are ready to discuss it. Here’s our 2026 schedule: (Quoted descriptions are from the library catalog unless otherwise noted.) January 6, 2026: Sourdough by Robin Sloan (fiction)We’re kicking off the year with a quick read about the very Bay Area intersection of tech and food culture. Lois is an exhausted software engineer who is gifted a very special sourdough starter by her favorite bakers when they must flee the country. Pretty soon she’s part of a mysterious underground food scene at the former Alameda Naval Air Station. February 3, 2026: Family Style: Memories of An American From Vietnam by Thien Pham (graphic memoir)The book that got the most votes from our members on our year-end poll! “Told through the lens of meaningful food and meals, this graphic novel chronicles the author’s childhood immigration to America, where food takes on new meaning as he and his family search for belonging, for happiness and for the American dream.” Pham is a graphic novelist, comic artist and educator based in Oakland. March 3, 2026: Deep Care: The Radical Activists Who Provided Abortions, Defied the Law, and Fought to Keep Clinics Open by Angela Hume (non-fiction)“The story of the radical feminist networks who worked outside the law to defend abortion. Deep Care follows generations of activists and clinicians who orbited the Women’s Choice clinic in Oakland from the early 1970s until 2010, as they worked underground and above ground, in small cells and broad coalitions and across political movements with grit, conviction, and allegiances of great trust to do what they believed needed to be done–despite the law, when required.” April 7, 2026: Moonglow by Michael Chabon (fiction)“A man bears witness to his grandfather’s deathbed confessions, which reveal his family’s long-buried history and his involvement in a mail-order novelty company, World War II and the space program.” Most of it isn’t set in Oakland, but it is the only book on this list that specifically mentions Montclair Library! May 5, 2026: Automatic Noodle by Annalee Newitz (science fiction)Our May read is a slim 163 pages, but packed with interesting ideas. This book is super popular as of December 2025, so you might want to get your hold in early. “In this semicozy tale set in a dystopian near future, robots open their own restaurant, build an unusual found family and achieve personal growth. A few years after the war that led to California’s secession from the United States, four robots awake in the flooded San Francisco takeout place where they were contracted to work.” (Kirkus) “Emboldened by newly granted civil rights from the California government, the bots reboot their lives in classic Bay Area form: by opening a noodle shop…In many ways, Newitz’s near-future San Francisco resembles today’s city, with not-so-subtle nods to AI anxieties, queer identity and the modern-day immigrant experience. It is, in the words of KQED’s Alexis Madrigal, ‘The most San Francisco book that has ever been or could ever have been written.’” (Leah Worthington) (Ebook listed separately) June 2, 2026: Moneyball by Michael Lewis (non-fiction)Baseball season is in full swing, which makes this the perfect time to read Michael Lewis’s nuanced exploration of “how Billy Beene, the general manager of the Oakland Athletics, used a new kind of thinking to build a successful and winning baseball team without spending enormous sums of money.” July 7, 2026: Girls Girls Girls by Shoshana von Blanckensee (fiction)In the summer of 1996, best friends (and secret girlfriends), Hannah and Sam drive from “New York, to the fabled queer paradise of San Francisco, free from the harsh gazes of their neighbors and the stifling demands of Hannah’s devout Orthodox Jewish mother. In San Francisco, they will finally be together as a real couple, out in the open, around other queer people.” But soon they’re working at a strip club, meeting new people and trying to figure out who just they are. August 4, 2026: Power Hungry: Women of the Black Panther Party and Freedom Summer and Their Fight to Feed a Movement by Suzanne Cope (non-fiction)Journey back with us to the summer of 1969 with the story of the free breakfast movement, grocery giveaways and other nurturing mutual aid programs started by the Black Panthers. “NYU writing professor Cope rescues two female activists from obscurity in this intriguing look at the role that food played in the civil rights and Black Power movements.” If you read One Crazy Summer with us in 2025, you’ll enjoy learning the backstory to the Panthers’ food program. September 1, 2026: Kasher in the Rye by Moshe Kasher (memoir)Go back to school with this “hilarious memoir about the absurdity of addiction.” “When he was a young boy, Kasher’s mother took him on a vacation to the West Coast. Well it was more like an abduction…They moved to Oakland, California. That’s where the real fun begins, in the war zone of Oakland Public Schools. Those early years read like part Augusten Burroughs, part David Sedaris, with a touch of Jim Carrol….Brutally honest and laugh-out-loud funny, Kasher…finds humor in even the most horrifying situations.” October 6, 2026: 107 Days by Kamala Harris (memoir)Hopefully by October the miles-long hold list for this book will have settled down enough for you to get a copy! “For the first time, and with surprising and revealing insights, Kamala Harris tells the story of one of the wildest and most consequential presidential campaigns in American history.” (NPR) November 3, 2026: The Giveaway: The Clay Blackburn Story by Owen Hill (crime fiction)We have something noir-ish by an Oakland author for those long November nights. “Hill’s crime fiction is whip-smart, stylish, subversive, hilarious and just dripping with East Bay color, culture and landmarks. Sweet and sour like a perfect Negroni, Hill has invented a new kind of East Bay Noir — the fog rolls in late, the golden afternoon glow somehow both luxurious and ominous in the class war that never sleeps.” (Recommendation from Tally Ho! Books via Oaklandside) December 1, 2026: Sign My Name to Freedom by Betty Reid Soskin (memoir)Reid Soskin, famous for being the oldest park ranger in the history of the National Park Service while working at the Rosie the Riveter National Park in Richmond, has been witness to a wide sweep of American history. She grew up in the Bay Area, raised four kids, ran a record store in Berkeley and more. “Betty just turned 104 and her memoir gives a fascinating look at African Americans migration, the Rosie the Riveter story, and beyond through the Civil Rights era.” (recommender) (Ebook and audiobook listed separately) « See our 2025 books here »« See our 2024 books here »« See our 2023 books here »Learn more about Montclair Library and its Friends group, FOML, here: About | Friends of Montclair Library",

The Murderbot Diaries Vol 1 description:On a distant planet, a team of scientists are conducting surface tests, shadowed by their Company-supplied ‘droid ― a self-aware SecUnit that has hacked its own governor module, and refers to itself (though never out loud) as “Murderbot.” Scornful of humans, all it really wants is to be left alone long enough to figure out who it is (and to watch its favorite show in its downtime.) But when a neighboring mission goes dark, it’s up to the scientists and Murderbot to get to the truth.",

We will introduce Volume 1 of a series to get you started on your next reading adventure. We encourage teens to read at least Volume 1, whether that is a physical copy from your own manga collection, from our library, or borrowed from a friend. Digital reading also counts; we will be happy to have you participate in our discussion if you have read an e-copy. Physical copies of Volume 1 will be available for in person pick-up at the Enon Branch on a first come, first served basis. Check out Libby and Hoopla for available digital copies. Scheduled for the second Monday of the month. For teens. This month's selection: Witch Hat Atelier by Kamome Shirahama Summary: In a world where everyone takes wonders like magic spells and dragons for granted, Coco is a girl with a simple dream: She wants to be a witch. But everybody knows magicians are born, not made, and Coco was not born with a gift for magic. Resigned to her un-magical life, Coco is about to give up on her dream to become a witch...until the day she meets Qifrey, a mysterious, traveling magician. After secretly seeing Qifrey perform magic in a way she's never seen before, Coco soon learns what everybody \"knows\" might not be the truth, and discovers that her magical dream may not be as far away as it may seem...” Rated 13 +",

Within the labyrinth of halls an ocean is imprisoned; waves thunder up staircases; rooms are flooded in an instant. But Piranesi is not afraid; he understands the tides as he understands the pattern of the labyrinth itself. He lives to explore the house.But as Piranesi explores, evidence emerges of another person, and a terrible truth begins to unravel, revealing a world beyond the one Piranesi has always known.Copies of Piranesi are available at Main while they last for sign out, or from various branch collections.",

This title should be on shelves and ready to borrow approximately 5 weeks prior to the discussion date. Check with a staff member if you have questions on how to access a copy.Book Description\"In a near-future Kolkata beset by flooding and blight, Ma, her two year old daughter Mishti, and her elderly father Dadu are just days from leaving the collapsing city behind to join Ma's husband in the home he has been building for them in Ann Arbor, Michigan. After procuring long-awaited passports and visas from the consulate, they pack their bags for the flight to America. But in the morning they awaken to discover that Ma's purse, with all the treasured documents within it, has been stolen. A Guardian and a Thief tells two stories: the story of Ma and her family, their struggle to emigrate to America, and their devastation in the wake of the theft that changes their fate to one of implacable tragedy; and Boomba, the thief, whose hunger and desperation to care for his family drive him to commit a crime whose consequences he cannot fathom. With stunning control and command, Megha Majumdar paints a kaleidoscopic portrait of two families whose destinies become inexorably entangled, wresting compassion from each narrative as the complexities of each character's circumstances-their helplessness in the face of poverty and corruption, and the need to stave off encroaching catastrophe--are captured with clarity and piercing empathy. A masterful new work from one of the most exciting voices of her generation\"--Provided by publisher.",

This title should be on shelves and ready to borrow approximately 5 weeks prior to the discussion date. Check with a staff member if you have questions on how to access a copy.Book Description\"A dazzling debut that asks: Can a name shape the course of a life? In the wake of an enormous, history-making storm, Cora sets off with her nine-year-old daughter, Maia, to register her son's birth. Her husband Gordon, a local doctor, respected in the community but a terrifying and controlling presence at home, intends for her to follow his family tradition going back generations, and name the child Gordon. But on the journey there, Cora wonders if it's right to impose the burden of this name and its legacy onto her tiny newborn son. She herself has Julian in mind, and Maia offers up her own suggestion: Bear. What follows are three alternate and alternating versions of both Cora's life and her young son's life shaped by her brave, last-minute choice of name. Spanning thirty-five years, the novel draws us in from the first page, as we follow three unforgettable journeys of one young man, but also his mother, grandmother, and sister. In richly layered prose, The Names explores the painful ripple effects of domestic abuse, the messy ties of family, and the possibilities of autonomy and healing.\"--Provided by publisher.",

Among them are a Wall Street wunderkind, a young woman coming to terms with an unexpected pregnancy, an injured veteran returning from Afghanistan, a business tycoon, and a free-spirited woman running away from her controlling husband. Halfway across the country, the plane crashes. Edward is the sole survivor.Edward’s story captures the attention of the nation, but he struggles to find a place in a world without his family. He continues to feel that a part of himself has been left in the sky, forever tied to the plane and all of his fellow passengers. But then he makes an unexpected discovery—one that will lead him to the answers of some of life’s most profound questions: When you’ve lost everything, how do you find the strength to put one foot in front of the other? How do you learn to feel safe again? How do you find meaning in your life?",

      "description": "Join us for the Swasey Book Club! April's selection is The Frozen River by Ariel Lawhon. About the book:\"A gripping historical mystery based on the real-life diary entries of Martha Ballard, an 18th-century midwife who defied the legal system and wrote herself into American history. Maine, 1789: When the Kennebec River freezes, entombing a man in the ice, Martha Ballard is summoned to examine the body and determine cause of death. As a midwife and healer, she is privy to much of what goes on behind closed doors in Hallowell. Her diary is a record of every birth and death, crime and debacle that unfolds in the close-knit community. When a local physician undermines her conclusion, declaring the death to be an accident, Martha is forced to investigate the shocking murder on her own. Over the course of one winter, as the trial nears, and whispers and prejudices mount, Martha doggedly pursues the truth. Her diary soon lands at the center of the scandal, implicating those she loves, and compelling Martha to decide where her own loyalties lie.\" Stop into the Swasey branch to secure your book club copy and then join us for the discussion on April 21. We hope you'll join us! The Swasey Book Club selection checks out on a first-come, first-served basis. Supply is limited. Ask library staff for assistance. Call us at (253)280-2970 if you have any questions.",

      "description": "Lush Lyricism and Intimate Confessions with Miranda Cowley Heller New York Times Bestselling Author of The Paper Palace and Reese’s Book Club PickAward-winning and bestselling author Miranda Cowley Heller takes us on an intimate journey through the life stages of a woman in her new poetry collection, What the Deep Water Knows. Delicate, yet exceedingly raw, these poems will transport you as vividly as any work of fiction. If I could fly backward, I would. To the safety of branches, to the time when my heart still raced for you, twelve hundred beats a minute. In poetry that is at once bold and lyrical, affecting and devastatingly frank, Miranda Cowley Heller takes us through childhood, marriage, motherhood, and beyond. Suffused with the natural world and the landscape of Cape Cod, where many of the poems are set, What the Deep Water Knows contemplates love in all the seasons. Register now to celebrate National Poetry Month with this graceful new poetry collection. About the Author: Miranda Cowley Heller was raised in New York City and Cape Cod. Her debut novel The Paper Palace was a number one New York Times bestseller in the US, a Sunday Times bestseller in the UK, and was longlisted for the Women’s Prize. She has worked as a senior vice president and head of drama series at HBO, developing and overseeing such shows as The Sopranos, Six Feet Under, The Wire, Deadwood, and Big Love, among others. This is her first poetry collection.",

      "description": "Join us and Chris Staudinger of Pretty Gritty Tours to discuss Plutopia, by Kate Brown.In Plutopia, Brown draws on official records and dozens of interviews to tell the stories of Richland, Washington and Ozersk, Russia--the first two cities in the world to produce plutonium. To contain secrets, American and Soviet leaders created plutopias--communities of nuclear families living in highly-subsidized, limited-access atomic cities. Brown shows that the plants' segregation of permanent and temporary workers and of nuclear and non-nuclear zones created a bubble of immunity, where dumps and accidents were glossed over and plant managers freely embezzled and polluted. In four decades, the Hanford plant near Richland and the Maiak plant near Ozersk each issued at least 200 million curies of radioactive isotopes into the surrounding environment--equaling four Chernobyls--laying waste to hundreds of square miles and contaminating rivers, fields, forests, and food supplies. This month's location will be at E9 Firehouse and Gastropub Plutopia Explore all of Tacoma Public Library's Book Clubs.",

      "description": "Join us at Kobetich Branch to discuss a new book each month. This month we will be reading The Martian by Andy Weir. We meet from 4-5pm. #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • NOW A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE A mission to Mars. A freak accident. One man’s struggle to survive. From the author of Project Hail Mary comes “a hugely entertaining novel that reads like a rocket ship afire” (Chicago Tribune). “Brilliant . . . a celebration of human ingenuity [and] the purest example of real-science sci-fi for many years . . . utterly compelling.”—The Wall Street Journal Six days ago, astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first people to walk on Mars. Now, he’s sure he’ll be the first person to die there. After a dust storm nearly kills him and forces his crew to evacuate while thinking him dead, Mark finds himself stranded and completely alone with no way to even signal Earth that he’s alive—and even if he could get word out, his supplies would be gone long before a rescue could arrive. Chances are, though, he won’t have time to starve to death. The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment, or plain-old “human error” are much more likely to kill him first. But Mark isn’t ready to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering skills—and a relentless, dogged refusal to quit—he steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next. Will his resourcefulness be enough to overcome the impossible odds against him? NAMED ONE OF PASTE’S BEST NOVELS OF THE DECADE “As gripping as they come . . . You’ll be rooting for Watney the whole way, groaning at every setback and laughing at his pitchblack humor. Utterly nail-biting and memorable.”—Financial Times The book is available for check out at the Kobetich circulation desk. The Kobetich Book Club meets on the last Wednesday of the month. New members are always welcome! Please call Kobetich library staff at 253-280-2921 for assistance with locating or reserving a copy.",

Register today and join us online.April 2026 Selection:Ocean's Godori by Elaine U. ChoExciting, fresh and unique perspective science fiction from a rising Seattle writer.Ocean Yoon has never felt very Korean, even if she is descended from a long line of haenyeo, Jeju Island's beloved female divers. She doesn't like soju, constantly misses cultural references, and despite her love of the game, people still say that she doesn't play Hwatu like a Korean. Ocean's also persona non grata at the Alliance, Korea's solar system-dominating space agency, since a mission went awry and she earned a reputation for being a little too quick with her gun. When her best friend, Teo, second son of the Anand Tech empire, is framed for murdering his family, Ocean and her misfit crewmates are pushed to the forefront of a high-stakes ideological conflict. But dodging bullets and winning space chases may be the easiest part of what comes next.“Ocean’s Godori navigates the space lane blazed by Becky Chambers and James S.A. Corey, but it manages to arrive at some exciting new destinations.” — Charlie Jane Anders, Washington PostOcean's Godori Speculative Fiction? What's that? Do you like science fiction? That's speculative fiction. Fantasy? OK, that's speculative fiction too.

      "description": "Join us online for an evening with author, Daniel H. Wilson.Wilson is a frequent New York Times bestseller with a long bibliography that spans speculative fiction, techno-thrillers, and science satire. His work is informed by his education and research background, including a Ph.D. in Robotics from Carnegie Mellon University. Early standouts include How to Survive a Robot Uprising (2005) and How to Build a Robot Army (2007), humorous but fact-based guides about the dangers of robotics and Al. Wilson may be best known to many for his documentary-style doomsday novel Robopocalypse (2011) and its sequel Robogenesis (2014). Subsequent work includes The Clockwork Dynasty (2017), an historical fantasy about a secret, immortal race of biological automatons whose existence has quietly shaped human history, and The Andromeda Evolution (2019), an authorized sequel to the Michael Crichton classic The Andromeda Strain. Wilson's latest novel, Hole in the Sky, is an alien encounter story inspired by the author's own Cherokee background. Notes The Seattle Times: \"Wilson reimagines first contact through an Indigenous lens, fusing Cherokee cosmology with cutting-edge science and creeping cosmic horror.\" This event is free. Visit facebook.com/ClubBook for more info and to join the discussion on May 4.",

For more information and a Zoom invite, contact Davo Knepler at nuevodavos@yahoo.com.We will be discussing California Dreaming by Noa Silber. Having grown up on stories of her mother's wild youth in California, Elena Berg relocates from New England to the Bay Area in 2011 for a placement as an English teacher with Teach for America. Once there, she is eager to inspire a love of poetry and literature in her diverse but underprivileged students. Her own grandfather--a Holocaust survivor--was a storyteller and teacher who touched the lives of his students for years to come. Elena's mother followed in his footsteps, leaving behind the hippie lifestyle of her twenties to become a university professor. But Elena quickly finds herself feeling disconnected from teaching, unable to inspire her students, and before long, she grows disillusioned with her career. She transitions to a role in an education technology startup--though she questions her decision, her motivations, and her values. Coming of age between the Occupy and #MeToo movements and against the backdrop of the 2016 election and California's ever-worsening fire season, Elena reckons with California as she imagined it and California as it really is. As she does so, she must also ultimately reconcile the person she envisioned herself to be with the person she actually is. For more information and a Zoom invite, contact Davo Knepler at nuevodavos@yahoo.com. Everyone is welcome to attend.

With her husband frequently deployed, Simone is left to find her place in this new world, alone—until she meets the wives.Gorrindo gives us an intimate look into the inner lives of a remarkable group of women and a tender, unflinching portrait of a marriage. A love story, an unforgettable coming-of-age tale, and a bracing tour of the intractable divisions that plague our country today, The Wives offers a rare and powerful gift: a hopeful stitch in the fabric of a torn America.",

But when her scheming mistress discovers the lump of a servant cowering in the kitchen is actually hiding a talent for little miracles, she demands Luzia use those gifts to improve the family's social position.What begins as simple amusement for the nobility takes a perilous turn when Luzia garners the notice of Antonio Pérez, the disgraced secretary to Spain's king. Still reeling from the defeat of his armada, the king is desperate for any advantage in the war against England's heretic queen—and Pérez will stop at nothing to regain the king's favor.Determined to seize this one chance to better her fortunes, Luzia plunges into a world of seers and alchemists, holy men and hucksters, where the lines between magic, science, and fraud are never certain. But as her notoriety grows, so does the danger that her Jewish blood will doom her to the Inquisition's wrath. She will have to use every bit of her wit and will to survive—even if that means enlisting the help of Guillén Santángel, an embittered immortal familiar whose own secrets could prove deadly for them both.",

For more information and a Zoom invite, contact Davo Knepler at nuevodavos@yahoo.com.We will be discussing The Fixer by Bernard Malamud. The Fixer is the winner of the 1967 National Book Award for Fiction and the 1967 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. It is Bernard Malamud's best-known and most acclaimed novel -- one that makes manifest his roots in Russian fiction, especially that of Isaac Babel.Set in Kiev in 1911 during a period of heightened anti-Semitism, the novel tells the story of Yakov Bok, a Jewish handyman blamed for the brutal murder of a young Russian boy. Bok leaves his village to try his luck in Kiev, and after denying his Jewish identity, finds himself working for a member of the anti-Semitic Black Hundreds Society. When the boy is found nearly drained of blood in a cave, the Black Hundreds accuse the Jews of ritual murder. Arrested and imprisoned, Bok refuses to confess to a crime that he did not commit.For more information and a Zoom invite, contact Davo Knepler at nuevodavos@yahoo.com. Everyone is welcome to attend.

Tricia is a shy newlywed, married to a rising attorney on loan to navy intelligence. Charlene is a practiced corporate spouse and mother of three, a beauty and a bully. In Saigon in 1963, the two women form a wary alliance as they balance the era’s mandate to be “helpmeets” to their ambitious husbands with their own inchoate impulse to “do good” for the people of Vietnam.Sixty years later, Charlene’s daughter, spurred by an encounter with an aging Vietnam vet, reaches out to Tricia. Together, they look back at their time in Saigon, taking wry account of that pivotal year and of Charlene’s altruistic machinations, and discovering how their own lives as women on the periphery—of politics, of history, of war, of their husbands’ convictions—have been shaped and burdened by the same sort of unintended consequences that followed America’s tragic interference in Southeast Asia.A virtuosic new novel from Alice McDermott, one of our most observant, most affecting writers, about folly and grace, obligation, sacrifice, and, finally, the quest for absolution in a broken world.",

      "description": "Join us to celebrate the love of reading with others in our community! The Lynnwood Library Book Group meets regularly on the second Monday of each month from 6:30-7:45pm. This month's selection is How to Age Disgracefully by Clare Pooley. Books are selected by members of the group and cover a variety of genres. When Lydia takes a job running the Senior Citizens' Social Club three afternoons a week, she assumes she'll be spending her time drinking tea and playing gentle games of cards. The members of the Social Club, however, are not at all what Lydia was expecting. From Art, a failed actor turned kleptomaniac to Daphne, who has been hiding from her dark past for decades to Ruby, a Banksy-style knitter who gets revenge in yarn, these seniors look deceptively benign--but when age makes you invisible, secrets are so much easier to hide. When the city council threatens to sell the doomed community center building, the members of the Social Club join forces with their tiny friends in the daycare next door--as well as the teenaged father of one of the toddlers and a geriatric dog--to save the building. Together, this group's unorthodox methods may actually work, as long as the police don't catch up with them first.View all of Lynnwood Library Book Group's 2026 selections.Contact us with questions Programs & Events FAQs To request a sign language interpreter, complete this online form or contact your local library at least two weeks prior to the library event.
