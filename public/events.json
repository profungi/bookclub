      "description": "Join other book lovers for a lively discussion regarding Percival Everett's James.\"From Percival Everett-a recipient of the NBCC Lifetime Achievement Award and finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, Booker Prize, and numerous PEN awards-comes James, a retelling of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, both harrowing and ferociously funny, told from the enslaved Jim's point of view. When the enslaved Jim overhears that he is about to be sold to a man in New Orleans, separated from his wife and daughter forever, he decides to hide on nearby Jackson Island until he can formulate a plan. Meanwhile, Huck Finn has faked his own death to escape his violent father, recently returned to town. As all readers of American literature know, thus begins the dangerous and transcendent journey by raft down the Mississippi River toward the elusive and too-often-unreliable promise of the Free States and beyond. While many narrative set pieces of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn remain in place (floods and storms, stumbling across both unexpected death and unexpected treasure in the myriad stopping points along the river's banks, encountering the scam artists posing as the Duke and Dauphin...), Jim's agency, intelligence and compassion are shown in a radically new light. Brimming with the electrifying humor and lacerating observations that have made Everett a \"cult literary icon\" (Oprah Daily), and one of the most decorated writers of our lifetime, James is destined to be a major publishing event and a cornerstone of twenty-first century American literature.\" - Penguin Random HouseNote that Moraga Book Club is a both an in-person event at Moraga Library and online (through Zoom).

Everyone who gets on the plane will get off. But almost all of them will be forever changed. Because on this ordinary, short, domestic flight, something extraordinary happens. People learn how and when they are going to die. For some, their death is far in the future—age 103!—and they laugh. But for six passengers, their predicted deaths are not far away at all. If you were told you only had a certain amount of time left to live, would you do things differently? Would you try to dodge your destiny?",

      "description": "Read the World is a book discussion group for youth in 6th to 9th grade. Each month we'll read a book set in a different country then enjoy conversations about the book as well as other cultures and experiences. We'll read from multiple categories, including fiction, nonfiction, graphic novels, novels in verse, and more. This month we'll be reading and discussing The Peach Thief by Linda Joan Smith and set in England. Please register then stop by the library for a free copy of the book available one month before the discussion.This shimmering middle-grade debut set in 1850s Lancashire, England, explores longing, belonging, and the courage it takes to find your place—and bloom.The night that workhouse orphan Scilla Brown dares to climb the Earl of Havermore’s garden wall, she wants only to steal a peach—the best thing she’s ever tasted in her hard, hungry life. But when she’s caught by the earl’s head gardener and mistaken for a boy, she grabs on to something more: a temporary job scrubbing flowerpots. If she can just keep up her deception, she’ll have a soft bed and food beyond her wildest dreams . . . maybe even peaches. She soon falls in with Phin, a garden apprentice who sneaks her into the steamy, fruit-filled greenhouses, calls her “Brownie,” and makes her skin prickle. At the same time, the gruff head gardener himself is teaching lowly Scilla to make things grow, and she’s cultivating hope with every seed she plants. But as the seasons unfurl, her loyalties become divided, and her secret grows harder to keep. How far will she go to have a home at last? Beautifully crafted with classic middle-grade themes of fate and ambition, identity and personal responsibility, this stunning debut features brisk pacing, crackling dialogue, and deep insight into what makes a garden thrive—and a heart and mind flourish.The Peach Thief An ASL (American Sign Language) interpreter can be provided for this program if requested at least seven (7) business days in advance.

When a golden opportunity for a promotion presents itself, the diverse members of Movement--among them a comedy-obsessed oddball who acts half his age, a young woman clinging to her \"cool kid\" status from high school, a college football hopeful trying to find a new path--band together and set a just-so-crazy-it-might-work plot in motion.\" AccessibilityNeed sign language interpretation or other accessibility assistance for this event?

But they are under threat as never before, and their problems are spreading across the continent. The Death and Life of the Great Lakes is prize-winning reporter Dan Egan's compulsively readable portrait of an ecological catastrophe happening right before our eyes, blending the epic story of the lakes with an examination of the perils they face and the ways we can restore and preserve them for generations to come.

We'll feature different titles and authors each month. Join us to share your impressions, thoughts and interpretations of a book we have all read. \"On Book Banning\" by Ira Wells SYNOPSIS: From the destruction of libraries in ancient Rome to today’s state-sponsored efforts to suppress LGBTQ+ literature, book bans arise from the impulse toward social control. In a survey of legal cases, literary controversies, and philosophical arguments, Ira Wells illustrates the historical opposition to the freedom to read and argues that today’s conservatives and progressives alike are warping our children’s relationship with literature and teaching them that the solution to opposing viewpoints is outright expurgation. At a moment in which our democratic institutions are buckling under the stress of polarization, On Book Banning is both rallying cry and guide to resistance for those who will always insist upon reading for themselves.",

      "description": "If you love talking tropes, subgenres, HEA versus HFN then this is the book club for you. Every month we'll read a different romance book and come together to discuss what we loved or hated. Books will range from closed door to explicit and explore a wide variety of subgenres. This month's pick is Quicksilver by Callie Heart.Twenty-four-year-old Saeris Fane is good at keeping secrets. No one knows about the strange powers she possesses, or the fact that she has been picking pockets and stealing from the Undying Queen's reservoirs for as long as she can remember. But a secret is like a knot. Sooner or later, it is bound to come undone. When Saeris comes face-to-face with Death himself, she inadvertently reopens a gateway between realms and is transported to a land of ice and snow. The Fae have always been the stuff of myth, of legend, of nightmares...but it turns out they're real, and Saeris has landed herself right in the middle of a centuries-long conflict that might just get her killed. The first of her kind to tread the frozen mountains of Yvelia in over a thousand years, Saeris mistakenly binds herself to Kingfisher, a handsome Fae warrior, who has secrets and nefarious agendas of his own. He will use her Alchemist's magic to protect his people, no matter what it costs him...or her. Death has a name. It is Kingfisher of the Ajun Gate. His past is murky. His attitude stinks. And he's the only way Saeris is going to make it home.Steam Level: 🔥🔥🔥🔥/5Quicksilver",

      "description": "This club meets monthly to discuss titles that feature LGBTQIA+ writers and characters. This program is provided by Pineville Library Staff and recommended for teens ages 14 to 18 and new adults 18-24. Information about this title:It's been a year since his best friend, Sam, died. Even though Oliver knows he won't get a response, he can't stop texting Sam's number, especially as the anniversary of his death approaches. Then one day he accidentally hits the call button, and someone picks up. The voice on the other end isn't Sam. Sam's number was reassigned and a stranger has been receiving Oliver's private and vulnerable messages for months. But Ben, a college student in Seattle, won't remain a stranger for long. When they finally meet in person, their spark is undeniable. Everything seems perfect until Oliver discovers something strange might be keeping them apart.Looking for the book?

After Tova Sullivan's husband died, she began working the night shift at the Sowell Bay Aquarium, mopping floors and tidying up. Keeping busy has always helped her cope, which she's been doing since her eighteen-year-old son, Erik, mysteriously vanished on a boat in Puget Sound over thirty years ago. Tova becomes acquainted with curmudgeonly Marcellus, a giant Pacific octopus living at the aquarium. Marcellus knows more than anyone can imagine but wouldn't dream of lifting one of his eight arms for his human captors—until he forms a remarkable friendship with Tova. Ever the detective, Marcellus deduces what happened the night Tova's son disappeared. And now Marcellus must use every trick his old invertebrate body can muster to unearth the truth for her before it's too late. Shelby Van Pelt's debut novel is a gentle reminder that sometimes taking a hard look at the past can help uncover a future that once felt impossible. A limited number of copies is available at the branch. AccessibilityNeed sign language interpretation or other accessibility assistance for this event?

Don't miss out on this opportunity to bond with fellow book-lovers over a shared love of literature and food.This month we will be reading The 99% Invisible City by Roman Mars and Kurt Kohlstedt.\"Have you ever wondered what those bright, squiggly graffiti marks on the sidewalk mean?Or stopped to consider why you don't see metal fire escapes on new buildings?Or pondered the story behind those dancing inflatable figures in car dealerships?99% Invisible is a big-ideas podcast about small-seeming things, revealing stories baked into the buildings we inhabit, the streets we drive, and the sidewalks we traverse. The show celebrates design and architecture in all of its functional glory and accidental absurdity, with intriguing tales of both designers and the people impacted by their designs.Now, in The 99% Invisible City: A Field Guide to Hidden World of Everyday Design, host Roman Mars and coauthor Kurt Kohlstedt zoom in on the various elements that make our cities work, exploring the origins and other fascinating stories behind everything from power grids and fire escapes to drinking fountains and street signs. With deeply researched entries and beautiful line drawings throughout, The 99% Invisible City will captivate devoted fans of the show and anyone curious about design, urban environments, and the unsung marvels of the world around them.\"We will be making traffic light cookies to accompany our discussion of the book.

      "description": "Open to all adults who love to read and discuss Nonfictional literature. In January, the Nonfiction Book Discussion Group will talk about Better living through birding: notes from a Black man in the natural world by Christian Cooper (2023) Christian Cooper is a self-described “Blerd” (Black nerd), an avid comics fan and expert birder who devotes every spring to gazing upon the migratory birds that stop to rest in Central Park. While birdwatching in Central Park in the spring of 2020, Cooper was falsely accused of physically attacking a white woman he encountered in the park, but successfully defended himself against the charge by videotaping her interaction with him with his phone. Cooper also writes about his boyhood love of birds, which never left him in adulthood. Feeling like a misfit in high school, Cooper found Harvard more welcoming. He discovered the Harvard Ornithological Club and the Gay Students Association, and he came out to his three roommates. He also writes about his enthusiasm for birdwatching as an adult, and about how it has helped him navigate life as a black man in the United States. All while being fully aware of the problems of police brutality, and who was likelier to be believed by the police and the public during his Central Park encounter with his accuser.The Adult Nonfiction Book Discussion Group meets on the second Sunday of each month at 11am in Room 201B. All meetings are sponsored by The Friends of the Cupertino Library For accessibility accommodations (ex. ASL), please fill out the online form at sccld.org/accessibility 7+days prior to the event.

The Murderbot Diaries Vol 1 description:On a distant planet, a team of scientists are conducting surface tests, shadowed by their Company-supplied ‘droid ― a self-aware SecUnit that has hacked its own governor module, and refers to itself (though never out loud) as “Murderbot.” Scornful of humans, all it really wants is to be left alone long enough to figure out who it is (and to watch its favorite show in its downtime.) But when a neighboring mission goes dark, it’s up to the scientists and Murderbot to get to the truth.",

We will introduce Volume 1 of a series to get you started on your next reading adventure. We encourage teens to read at least Volume 1, whether that is a physical copy from your own manga collection, from our library, or borrowed from a friend. Digital reading also counts; we will be happy to have you participate in our discussion if you have read an e-copy. Physical copies of Volume 1 will be available for in person pick-up at the Enon Branch on a first come, first served basis. Check out Libby and Hoopla for available digital copies. Scheduled for the second Monday of the month. For teens. This month's selection: Delicious in Dungeon by Ryoko Kui Summary: When young adventurer Laios and his company are attacked and soundly thrashed by a dragon deep in a dungeon, the party loses all its money and provisions...and a member! They're eager to go back and save her, but there is just one problem: If they set out with no food or coin to speak of, they're sure to starve on the way! But Laios comes up with a brilliant idea: \"Let's eat the monsters!\" Slimes, basilisks, and even dragons...none are safe from the appetites of these dungeon-crawling gourmands!” Rated 13+",

From LibraryReads, \"Backman's most complex novel to date takes place in the small, hockey-crazed village of Beartown. He deftly weaves together the stories of the players, the coaches, the parents, and the fans as Beartown's hockey team chases its dream of winning a championship. Weighty themes are explored. How high a price is too high for success? How deadly is silence? Who can you trust with your secrets? How far will you compromise your beliefs in the name of friendship? There are no easy answers.\" To place a hold on a physical or digital click here.",

Don't forget to grab your copy from the children's desk. This year's fifth graders are the worst Principal Klein has ever seen. But he's hoping that Spirit Week can teach them teamwork, with a top secret prize for the winning team as incentive.Best friends George and Lilly have been looking forward to Spirit Week all year. They might be complete opposites, but they can't wait to be on the winning team together. When their classes end up rivals, with Lilly leading Team Red and George leading Team Blue, the friends swear they can compete and remain best friends.But suddenly there are slimed lockers, sabotaged costumes, and class pets held hostage. As the mischief escalates, it threatens everything, including the prize. Because if Principal Klein finds out, Spirit Week will be canceled and the students will spend the rest of the year in detention. Can George and Lilly find a way to fix their friendship and get the entire fifth grade to play fair, or is the most awesome week of fifth grade about to make this the worst school year ever?",

Bird knows to not ask too many questions, stand out too much, or stray too far. For a decade, their lives have been governed by laws written to preserve 'American culture' in the wake of years of economic instability and violence. To keep the peace & restore prosperity, the authorities are now allowed to relocate children of dissidents, especially those of Asian origin, & libraries have been forced to remove books seen as unpatriotic including the work of Bird's mother, Margaret, a Chinese American poet who left the family when he was nine years old. Bird has grown up disavowing his mother & her poems ; he doesn't know her work or what happened to her, & he knows he shouldn't wonder. But when he receives a mysterious letter containing only a cryptic drawing, he is drawn into a quest to find her. His journey will take him back to the many folktales she poured into his head as a child, through the ranks of an underground network of librarians, into the lives of the children who have been taken, & finally to New York City, where a new act of defiance may be the beginning of much-needed change.\" A limited number of copies of the book selection are made available each month for check-out at the downstairs circulation desk at the branch.",

      "library_slug": "sno-isle",
      "description": "Join us to celebrate the love of reading with others in our community! This month's selection is James by Percival Everett. When the enslaved Jim overhears that he is about to be sold to a man in New Orleans, separated from his wife and daughter forever, he decides to hide on nearby Jackson Island until he can formulate a plan. Meanwhile, Huck Finn has faked his own death to escape his violent father, recently returned to town. As all readers of American literature know, thus begins the dangerous and transcendent journey by raft down the Mississippi River toward the elusive and too-often-unreliable promise of the Free States and beyond. While many narrative set pieces of Twain's original novel remain in place, Jim’s agency, intelligence and compassion are shown in a radically new light.Visit the following link to view all of Lynnwood Library Book Group's 2026 selections: Lynnwood Library Book Club 2026 Titles. Books are selected by members of the group and cover a variety of genres. The Lynnwood Library Book Group meets regularly on the second Monday of each month from 6:30-7:45pm. Contact us with questions Programs & Events FAQs To request a sign language interpreter, complete this online form or contact your local library at least two weeks prior to the library event.

If your answer is yes to all of the above, sign up for our tween book club to join us for a lively discussion along with a fun activity. This program is for ages 9-12. Registration is required. We will meet in-person in the Spring Branch Memorial Library Meeting Room. Once registered, you will be contacted when a copy of the book is available for pick up. The book we will be reading: Anzu and the Realm of Darkness by Mai K. Nguyen. Anzu has just moved to a new town during Obon, a time for families to remember and celebrate their ancestors. Ever since her Obaachan died, though, Obon has lost its magic. She doesn't feel much like celebrating anymore.While avoiding holiday festivities, Anzu spots a stray dog down the street. A dog that seems to be staring right at her. But when she chases after it, she slips and falls down a ridge, losing consciousness. When she awakes, she’s in the Shinto underworld known as Yomi, a place she’s only heard about in Obaachan’s stories. The stray dog, she finds out, is actually the Gatekeeper of Yomi, and he warns her to return to the human realm before it’s too late.Only, getting home is not as simple as she’d thought. Faced with the nefarious Queen Izanami of Yomi and a world full of creatures she’d once thought weren’t real, the race against the clock is on. She must break a curse, free the spirits of other lost children, and reach the gate home before sunrise…or be stuck in Yomi forever.",

This program is not led by an instructor--it's a social circle for sharing, building understanding and community. Meet up with other knitters or crocheters for self-directed projects in yarn and thread. Bring your own project to work on--no supplies are provided. While you're here, check out our many crafting books with knitting and crocheting projects to try. We meet weekly, every Wednesday afternoon from 1:00pm to 3:00 pm. This program will take place indoors at the North County Regional Library. Indoor programs will be operating at a reduced attendance capacity and will include social distancing based on the library space. Want to be notified about future events?

      "description": "The Cupertino Library Adult Book Discussion Group begins 2026 talking about the novel Clear by Carys Davies (2024). In 1843, Scotland is a troubled country. Impoverished tenants are being ruthlessly evicted from their homes in favor of clearing the land for more profitable sheep. Many Presbyterian ministers are simultaneously revolting against the power of wealthy landowners to form the Free Church of Scotland, although this means they also lose their needed wages. John Ferguson is one such clergyman, and out of desperation, he accepts the unpleasant assignment of traveling hundreds of miles to evict the last human tenant from a remote Island in the North Sea. This task becomes even more morally complicated when he and Ivar, the tenant, become friends against the odds. The Adult Book Discussion Group meets on the third Wednesday of each month at 11am, and on the third Thursday evening at 7pm in room 201B. Adults of all ages are welcome. All meetings are sponsored by The Friends of the Cupertino Library For accessibility accommodations (ex. ASL), please fill out the online form at sccld.org/accessibility 7+days prior to the event. If you need assistance with the form, speak with a staff member at your local library, call (408) 540-3945, or email us at ask@sccl.org.",

      "description": "Join us on the 2nd Wednesday of each month at 3pm for Inquisitive Minds: Nonfiction Book Club! We will meet in the Community Room at SouthPark Regional Library. This month (January) we're discussing: A Walk in the Park: The True Story of a Spectacular Misadventure in the Grand Canyon by Kevin Fedarko \"From the New York Times bestselling and award-winning author of the epic adventure tale The Emerald Mile comes the most dramatic and deeply moving account ever of walking the Grand Canyon, a highly dangerous, life-changing 750-mile trek. The Grand Canyon is an American treasure, visited by more than 6 million people a year, many of whom are rendered speechless by its vast beauty, mystery, and complexity. Now, in A Walk in the Park, author Kevin Fedarko chronicles his year-long effort to find a 750-mile path along the length of the Grand Canyon, through a vertical wilderness suspended between the caprock along the rims of the abyss and the Colorado River, which flows along its bottom. Consisting of countless cliffs and steep drops, plus immense stretches with almost no access to water, and the fact that not a single trail links its eastern doorway to its western terminus, this jewel of national parks is so challenging that when Fedarko departed fewer people had completed the journey in one single hike than had walked on the moon. The intensity of the effort required him to break his trip into several legs, each of which held staggering dangers and unexpected discoveries. Accompanying Fedarko through this sublime yet perilous terrain is the award-winning photographer Peter McBride, who captures the stunning landscape in breathtaking photos. Together, they encounter long-lost Native American ruins, the remains of Old West prospectors' camps, present day tribal activists, and signs that commercial tourism is impinging on the park's remote wildness. An epic adventure, action-packed survival tale, and a deep spiritual journey, A Walk in the Park gives us an unprecedented glimpse of the crown jewel of America's National Parks: an iconic landscape framed by ancient rock whose contours are recognized by all, but whose secrets and treasures are known to almost no one, and whose topography encompasses some of the harshest, least explored, most awe-inspiring terrain in the world.\" This program will be provided by the SouthPark Regional Library staff.

Since the fall of 2016, Saint Paul Public Library has been a Next Chapter Book Club affiliate. Next Chapter Book Club offers community-based book clubs for adolescents and adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Our members (including some who cannot read) love the way books transport them to different worlds where they meet interesting characters and learn about exciting new things. Taking that journey with a group of friends makes it even more delightful and fun. Join us online (click this link to connect to the virtual book club) Wednesdays 5-6 pm until we reach the end of the book. Estimated end date in March. Contact Erin at erin.zolotukhin-ridgway@ci.stpaul.mn.us with questions. This book will be shared online during book club.",

Adina Giorno is tiny and jaundiced, but reaches for warmth and light. As a child, she recognizes that she is different; she also possesses knowledge of a faraway planet. The arrival of a fax machine enables her to contact her extraterrestrial relatives, beings who have sent her to report on the oddities of earthlings. For years, as she moves through the world and makes a life for herself among humans, she dispatches transmissions on the terrors and surprising joys of their existence. But at a precarious moment, a beloved friend urges Adina to share her messages with the world. Is there a chance she is not alone?",

To celebrate the exhibit, the History Center has partnered with the Saint Paul Public Library to host a book club featuring Precious and Adored by Lizzie Ehrenhalt and Tilly Laskey. Precious and Adored highlights the correspondence between Rose Cleveland, sister of President Grover Cleveland, and Evangeline Simpson, a wealthy widow who would become the second wife of Henry Whipple, Minnesota's Episcopal bishop. The women corresponded across states and continents, discussing their advocacy and humanitarian work - and demonstrating their sexual attraction, romance, and partnership. Participate in the book club to learn more about this portrayal of nineteenth-century LGBTQ history, then visit “The Stories We Keep” to see original letters from the MNHS collections. Participation in this book club includes a copy of the book and two free passes to the Minnesota History Center to see the exhibit. This book club is for adults.",

This event is a part of the annual Silicon Valley Reads (SV Reads) program.Wednesday, January 14, 2026, 5:30 p.m. The Power of Bridging, by John A. Powell. This is a Silicon Valley Reads book for 2026. How to Build a World Where We All Belong. A bold guide for connecting across differences - even those that seem impossible. \"Wise and visionary, powell helps us find the courage to forge connections with others, the earth, and ourselves in order to transform the world from the inside out.\" -Valarie Kaur. We don't want to live in a society in turmoil. In fact, 93 percent of people in the US want to reduce divisiveness, and 86 percent believe it's possible to disagree in a healthy way. Yet with increasing political and social fragmentation, many of us don't know how to move past our differences. Civil rights scholar, john a. powell, presents an actionable path through \"bridging\" that helps us communicate, coexist, and imagine a new story for our shared future where we all belong. With inimitable warmth and vision, powell offers a framework for building cohesion and solidarity between disparate beliefs and backgrounds. Bridging is more than a discrete list of actions to follow - it's a mindset we can develop to help us foster belonging and connection. Key elements of the bridging mindset include: Understanding how deeply \"othering\" shapes our world, priming us to see difference of any kind - race, gender, political orientation, etc. - as a threat Identifying where \"breaking\" happens, when people are excluded or treated differently for being perceived as other. Embracing \"belonging\" as one of our core human needs - we all want to feel seen, valued, and appreciated just as we are. Committing ourselves to treat all people like they belong. Allowing ourselves grace when we inevitably fall short - and resolving to try again. Throughout the book, powell shares personal reflections as well as practices to help you begin bridging wherever you are - in your community, friendships, family, workplace - even with those whom you might never have imagined you could find common ground. \"Bridging is a salve for our fractured world,\" powell says. \"We can overcome the illusion of separateness by honoring our differences, transcending the notion that difference divides us, and instead cocreate a world where everyone belongs.\" Wednesday, February 11, 2026, 5:30 p.m. \"Iona Iverson's Rules for Commuting,\" by Clara Pooley.

For more information and a Zoom invite, contact Davo Knepler at nuevodavos@yahoo.com.We will be discussing Fagin the Thief by Allison Epstein, a One Bay One Book selection. The author will be joining us for the discussion. Long before Oliver Twist stumbled onto the scene, Jacob Fagin was scratching out a life for himself in the dark alleys of nineteenth-century London. Born in the Jewish enclave of Stepney shortly after his father was executed as a thief, Jacob and his open-minded mother, Leah, are each other's whole world. But Jacob's prospects are forever altered when a light-fingered pickpocket takes Jacob under his wing and teaches him a trade that pays far better than the neighborhood boys could possibly dream. Striking out on his own, Jacob familiarizes himself with London's highest value neighborhoods while forging his own path in the shadows. But everything changes when he adopts an aspiring teenage thief named Bill Sikes, whose mercurial temper poses a danger to himself and anyone foolish enough to cross him. Along the way, Jacob's found family expands to include his closest friend, Nancy, and his greatest protege, the Artful Dodger. But as Bill's ambition soars and a major robbery goes awry, Jacob is forced to decide what he really stands for--and what a life is worth.For more information and a Zoom invite, contact Davo Knepler at nuevodavos@yahoo.com.

This title should be on shelves and ready to borrow approximately 5 weeks prior to the discussion date. Check with a staff member if you have questions on how to access a copy.Book Description\"Beth and her gentle, kind husband Frank are happily married, but their relationship relies on the past staying buried. But when Beth’s brother-in-law shoots a dog going after their sheep, Beth doesn’t realize that the gunshot will alter the course of their lives. For the dog belonged to none other than Gabriel Wolfe, the man Beth loved as a teenager—the man who broke her heart years ago. Gabriel has returned to the village with his young son Leo, a boy who reminds Beth very much of her own son, who died in a tragic accident.As Beth is pulled back into Gabriel’s life, tensions around the village rise and dangerous secrets and jealousies from the past resurface, this time with deadly consequences. Beth is forced to make a choice between the woman she once was, and the woman she has become.A sweeping love story with the pace and twists of a thriller, Broken Country is a novel of simmering passion, impossible choices, and explosive consequences that toggles between the past and present to explore the far-reaching legacy of first love.\" --Provided by publisher.",

      "description": "The Civic Center Library's Afternoon Book Club will meet in person on Thursday, January 15th from 1:00-2:00 to discuss Winesburg, Ohio by Sherwood Anderson. This afternoon book club generally meets on the 3rd Thursday of every month from 1:00-2:00pm. All are welcome to join! Request a copy of the book online or ask at the Info Desk of the Civic Center Library (or call 415-473-6057) for assistance in placing a hold. View in catalog to see multiple available formats .... Winesburg, Ohio by Sherwood Anderson A collection of interconnected short stories set in a fictional Midwestern town in the 1890s, this work by Sherwood Anderson was groundbreaking and set the stage for a new era in writing, greatly influencing Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner, John Steinbeck, and many others. The stories revolve around George Willard, a young reporter who observes and interacts with the town’s inhabitants. Each story delves into the lives of individuals grappling with isolation, regret, and the pursuit of meaning. Anderson’s sensitive prose and deep empathy bring to life characters who are both flawed and profoundly human.Considered by many at the time of publication (1919) to be a scandalous work, Winesburg, Ohio has survived through the decades as one of the forerunners of modern fiction. - adapted from the publisher ADA Accommodation Request | Solicitud de Adaptación ADA",

This title should be on shelves and ready to borrow approximately 5 weeks prior to the discussion date. Check with a staff member if you have questions on how to access a copy.Book Description: \"A cross-cultural love story set against the dramatic backdrop of the Allied invasion of Europe in WWII. Vancouver, 1942. Josiah Chang arrives in the bustling city ready to serve his country in the war against fascism, but Chinese Canadians are barred from joining the army out of fear they might expect citizenship in return. So, Josiah heads to the shipyard to find work as a riveter, fastening together the ribs and steel plates of Victory ships. One night, Josiah spots Poppy singing at a navy club. Despite their different backgrounds, they fall for each other instantly and begin a starry-eyed romance that lasts until the harsh reality of their situation is made clear. Determined to prove himself, Josiah takes a train to Toronto where he’s finally given the chance to enlist. After volunteering for the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion and jumping into Normandy on D-Day, he must fight through the battlefields of Europe to make it back to the woman he loves. By turns harrowing and exhilarating, The Riveter explores what one man must sacrifice to belong to the only country he has ever called home.\" -- Provided by Publisher",

There they must overcome their fears and solve the Ice Wizard’s riddle, because if Jack and Annie don’t complete their mission in time, Merlin and Morgan will disappear forever! This book will be read in three parts on January 15, 22, and 29. About Our Book Club: Each week, an AAC user hosts our sessions, and a librarian reads our story. After each reading, we enjoy an activity or game connected to the book, celebrating representation, creativity, and the many wonderful ways people communicate. We celebrate all forms of communication—AAC, speech, gestures, and expressions—and follow a Floortime-inspired approach that centers on meeting readers where they are and building joyful shared experiences. When applicable, a visual schedule will be emailed 24 hours before each session to help our readers follow along. Special thanks to Mary Pope Osborne and Penguin Random House for allowing us to read The Magic Tree House Merlin Missions: #4 Winter of the Ice Wizard in our virtual book club.",

      "description": "The Cupertino Library Adult Book Discussion Group begins 2026 talking about the novel Clear by Carys Davies (2024). In 1843, Scotland is a troubled country. Impoverished tenants are being ruthlessly evicted from their homes in favor of clearing the land for more profitable sheep. Many Presbyterian ministers are simultaneously revolting against the power of wealthy landowners to form the Free Church of Scotland, although this means they also lose their needed wages. John Ferguson is one such clergyman, and out of desperation, he accepts the unpleasant assignment of traveling hundreds of miles to evict the last human tenant from a remote Island in the North Sea. This task becomes even more morally complicated when he and Ivar, the tenant, become friends against the odds. The Adult Book Discussion Group meets on the third Wednesday of each month at 11am, and on the third Thursday evening at 7pm in room 201B. Adults of all ages are welcome. All meetings are sponsored by The Friends of the Cupertino Library For accessibility accommodations (ex. ASL), please fill out the online form at sccld.org/accessibility 7+days prior to the event. If you need assistance with the form, speak with a staff member at your local library, call (408) 540-3945, or email us at ask@sccl.org.",

Recommended for ages 9-15 with prior experience in TinkerCAD or 3D design. If attendees want to create an object larger than 6cm x 6cm x 6cm, parents must complete the certification and bring a USB to the class so that the Makerspace can support with processing the print! To 3D print at the Makerspace: An adult (or youth aged 12+) must be certified to 3D print, which is a quick online process found on our website!Book the printer by calling 780-944-5342, email makerspace@epl.ca, or chat face to face with Makerspace staff!Slice the design in the Makerspace, in Children's library, in our class, or on your own devices!Bring the file on a USB to the Makerspace to process.

      "description": "Love reading? Love to talk about books you've read? Join our book club for spirited discussions on a wide range of fiction and non-fiction. Each month we'll tackle a new title. Whether you loved it, loathed it, or left it unfinished, we want to hear your take. Come share your impressions and connect with fellow readers! This week we will be reading Lessons in Chemistry by Bonnie Garmus. “A delight for readers of Where'd You Go, Bernadette , this blockbuster debut set in 1960s California features the singular voice of Elizabeth Zott, a scientist whose career takes a detour when she becomes the star of a beloved TV cooking show.Chemist Elizabeth Zott is not your average woman. In fact, Elizabeth Zott would be the first to point out that there is no such thing as an average woman. But it's the early 1960s and her all-male team at Hastings Research Institute takes a very unscientific view of equality. Except for one: Calvin Evans, the lonely, brilliant, Nobel Prize-nominated grudge holder who falls in love with--of all things--her mind. True chemistry results.Like science, though, life is unpredictable. Which is why a few years later Eizabeth Zott finds herself not only a single mother but also the reluctant star of America's most beloved cooking show, Supper at Six . Elizabeth's unusual approach to cooking (\"combine one tablespoon acetic acid with a pinch of sodium chloride\") proves revolutionary. But as her following grows, not everyone is happy. Because, as it turns out, Elizabeth Zott isn't just teaching women how to cook. She's daring them to change the status quo.Laugh-out-loud funny, shrewdly observant and studded with a dazzling cast of supporting characters, Lessons in Chemistry is as original and vibrant as its protagonist.”",

The Connection Cure combines diligent science reporting, moving patient success stories, and surprising self-discovery to help us discover the lasting and life-changing power of social prescribing. Traditionally, when we get sick, health care professionals ask, “What’s the matter with you?” But around the world, teams of doctors, nurses, therapists, and social workers have started to flip the script, asking “What matters to you?” Science shows that social prescribing is effective for treating symptoms of the modern world’s most common ailments—depression, ADHD, addiction, trauma, anxiety, chronic pain, dementia, diabetes, and loneliness. By integrating age-old medicines like art, nature, movement, and volunteer service into patient’s daily lives, social prescriptions are radically changing health and healthcare in more than thirty countries. Julia Hotz travels around the world to survey them —sea-swimming lessons for depression, “culture vitamins” for anxiety, a fishing club for ADHD, a farm-based day-care for dementia, a phone-buddy program for social isolation, and many more. As the first book on social prescribing, The Connection Cure empowers you to find, experience, and implement this revolutionary medicine in your own community. The success stories Julia finds bring a long-known theory to life: if we can change our environment, we can change our health. By reconnecting to what matters to us, we can all start to feel better. Register today to find out how you can use the wisdom of social prescribing to live your best life! About the Author: Julia Hotz is a solutions focused journalist based in New York.

The Connection Cure shows how reconnecting to what matters can improve well-being, offering a hopeful path toward healing and stronger communities.This program is part of Santa Clara County Library District's celebration of Silicon Valley Reads. --- The free, virtual series is open to the public and takes place two to three times a month.

January’s discussion will cover chapters 1-100, and February’s discussion will cover chapters 101- end of the book. (Ask for a reading calendar to keep you on schedule.) When Roots was first published forty years ago, the book electrified the nation: it received a Pulitzer Prize and was a #1 New York Times bestseller for 22 weeks. In the five decades since then, the story of the young African slave Kunta Kinte and his descendants has lost none of its power to enthrall and provoke. \"Alex Haley's Roots is unquestionably one of the nation's seminal texts.”- Michael Eric Dyson",

      "description": "Join us to discuss parts 1-4 of Homecoming by Kate Morton. --- Adelaide Hills, Christmas Eve, 1959: At the end of a scorching hot day, beside a creek on the grounds of the grand and mysterious mansion, a local delivery man makes a terrible discovery. A police investigation is called and the small town of Tambilla becomes embroiled in one of the most shocking and perplexing murder cases in the history of South Australia.Sixty years later, Jess is a journalist in search of a story. Having lived and worked in London for almost twenty years, she now finds herself laid off from her full-time job and struggling to make ends meet. A phone call out of nowhere summons her back to Sydney, where her beloved grandmother, Nora, who raised Jess when her mother could not, has suffered a fall and been raced to the hospital.Nora has always been a vibrant and strong presence: decisive, encouraging, young despite her years. When Jess visits her in the hospital, she is alarmed to find her grandmother frail and confused. It’s even more alarming to hear from Nora's housekeeper that Nora had been distracted in the weeks before her accident and had fallen on the steps to the attic—the one place Jess was forbidden from playing in when she was small.At loose ends in Nora's house, Jess does some digging of her own. In Nora's bedroom, she discovers a true crime book, chronicling the police investigation into a long-buried tragedy: the Turner Family Tragedy of Christmas Eve, 1959. It is only when Jess skims through the book that she finds a shocking connection between her own family and this once-infamous crime—a crime that has never been resolved satisfactorily. And for a journalist without a story, a cold case might be the best distraction she can find…Copies of the book will be reserved and available at the library and electronic versions can be found on Hoopla or Libby.Registration for this event is encouraged but not required.",

We'll feature different titles and authors each month. Come and share your impressions, thoughts and interpretations of a book we have all read. This week we will be reading Where'd You Go, Bernadette: A Novel by Maria SempleBernadette Fox is notorious. To her Microsoft-guru husband, she's a fearlessly opinionated partner; to fellow private-school mothers in Seattle, she's a disgrace; to design mavens, she's a revolutionary architect; and to 15-year-old Bee, she is her best friend and, simply, Mom.Then Bernadette vanishes. It all began when Bee aced her report card and claimed her promised reward: a family trip to Antarctica. But Bernadette's intensifying allergy to Seattle -- and people in general -- has made her so agoraphobic that a virtual assistant in India now runs her most basic errands. A trip to the end of the earth is problematic.To find her mother, Bee compiles email messages, official documents, and secret correspondence -- creating a compulsively readable and surprisingly touching novel about misplaced genius and a mother and daughter's role in an absurd world.",

      "description": "Come to a great discussion at the Bellhop Café! We are a small group that enjoys great coffee and books! ---This month is Eleanore of Avignon by Elizabeth DeLozierProvence, 1347. Eleanore (Elea) Blanchet is a midwife and budding herbalist with remarkable skills. But as she knows all too well from her late mother’s fate, she must be careful to stay within her station. So, she quietly accepts her role tending to the pregnant women in her home city of Avignon; spending time with her father and beloved twin sister, Margot; and escaping to the surrounding woods to forage for herbs when she can. At the very least, she is determined to preserve the little freedom she does have by staying unwed—unlike Margot, who is about to marry a man with painful connections to their mother’s death.Then, in a chance encounter, Elea meets Guy de Chauliac, “Guigo,” the enigmatic personal physician to the powerful Pope Clement, who, against all odds, agrees to take her on as his apprentice. Under his tutelage, a whole new world opens to Elea—a world of status, wealth, and fascinating medical cases—but just as she starts to settle into her new position, the much-feared plague hits Europe, making Elea and Guigo's work more urgent than ever. And as if that weren’t enough, the disgraced Queen Joanna of Naples arrives in Avignon to stand trial for her husband’s murder—and she is pregnant and in need of a midwife, a role only Elea can fill.As the Black Death spreads like wildfire, leaving half the city dead in its wake—and as the queen's childbirth approaches—Elea finds herself battling what seems to be an unwinnable war. All the while, the people of Avignon are becoming more and more desperate for a scapegoat, and a group of religious heretics launch a witch hunt, one that could cost her everything. Pick up a copy at the reference desk at Winters Library or download a copy through Hoopla. Register if you would like an email reminder.",

      "description": "Want to connect with others over the love of reading? Join our book club to discuss Fredrik Backman's My Friends. This title should be on shelves and ready to borrow approximately 5 weeks prior to the discussion date. Check with a staff member if you have questions on how to access a copy.Book Description\"#1 New York Times bestselling author Fredrik Backman, who \"captures the messy essence of being human\" (The Washington Post), returns with an unforgettably funny, deeply moving tale of four teenagers whose friendship creates a bond so powerful that it changes a stranger's life twenty-five years later. Most people don't even notice them-three tiny figures sitting at the end of a long pier in the corner of one of the most famous paintings in the world. Most people think it's just a depiction of the sea. But Louisa, an artist herself, knows otherwise and she is determined to find out the story of these three enigmatic figures. Twenty-five years earlier, in a distant town, a group of teenagers find refuge from their difficult home lives by spending their days laughing and telling stories out on a pier. There's Joar, who never backs down from a fight; quiet and bookish Ted who is mourning his father; Ali, the daughter of a man who never stays in one place for long; and finally, there's the artist, a boy who hoards sleeping pills and shuns attention, but who possesses an extraordinary gift that might be his ticket to a better life. These four lost souls find in each other a reason to get up each morning, a reason to dream. Out of that summer emerges a transcendent work of art, a painting that will unexpectedly be put into eighteen-year-old Louisa's care. As she struggles to decide what to do with this bequest, she embarks on a surprise-filled cross-country journey to learn the story of how the painting came to be. The closer she gets to the painting's birthplace, the more she feels compelled to unleash her own artistic spirit, but happy endings don't always take the form we expect in this fresh testament to the transformative power of friendship and art\"--Provided by publisher.",

      "library_slug": "greenelibrary",
      "description": "This book discussion group is for all historical fiction readers. Dive deeper into events that changed the world. --- This month's selection is Eleanore of Avignon by Elizabeth DeLozierProvence, 1347. Eleanore (Elea) Blanchet is a midwife and budding herbalist with remarkable skills. But as she knows all too well from her late mother’s fate, she must be careful to stay within her station. So, she quietly accepts her role tending to the pregnant women in her home city of Avignon; spending time with her father and beloved twin sister, Margot; and escaping to the surrounding woods to forage for herbs when she can. At the very least, she is determined to preserve the little freedom she does have by staying unwed—unlike Margot, who is about to marry a man with painful connections to their mother’s death.Then, in a chance encounter, Elea meets Guy de Chauliac, “Guigo,” the enigmatic personal physician to the powerful Pope Clement, who, against all odds, agrees to take her on as his apprentice. Under his tutelage, a whole new world opens to Elea—a world of status, wealth, and fascinating medical cases—but just as she starts to settle into her new position, the much-feared plague hits Europe, making Elea and Guigo's work more urgent than ever. And as if that weren’t enough, the disgraced Queen Joanna of Naples arrives in Avignon to stand trial for her husband’s murder—and she is pregnant and in need of a midwife, a role only Elea can fill.As the Black Death spreads like wildfire, leaving half the city dead in its wake—and as the queen's childbirth approaches—Elea finds herself battling what seems to be an unwinnable war. All the while, the people of Avignon are becoming more and more desperate for a scapegoat, and a group of religious heretics launch a witch hunt, one that could cost her everything.

She inspired the French army to a pivotal victory at the Siege of Orléans in 1429 and helped secure the coronation of Charles VII. Captured by the Burgundians and handed over to the English, she was put on trial for heresy, burned at the stake at age 19, and later canonized as a saint and national heroine of France.As always in our subject based book club, we will have several books about Joan of Arc available on display. On discussion day, we will show a video about the accepted historical facts on the subject. And of course, pastries and coffee will be supplied during the event",

His job is to destroy the most illegal of commodities, the printed book, along with the houses in which they are hidden. Montag never questions the destruction and ruin his actions produce, returning each day to his bland life and wife, Mildred, who spends all day with her television \"family.\" But when he meets an eccentric young neighbor, Clarisse, who introduces him to a past where people didn't live in fear and to a present where one sees the world through the ideas in books instead of the mindless chatter of television, Montag begins to question everything he has ever known.",

There they must overcome their fears and solve the Ice Wizard’s riddle, because if Jack and Annie don’t complete their mission in time, Merlin and Morgan will disappear forever! This book will be read in three parts on January 15, 22, and 29. About Our Book Club: Each week, an AAC user hosts our sessions, and a librarian reads our story. After each reading, we enjoy an activity or game connected to the book, celebrating representation, creativity, and the many wonderful ways people communicate. We celebrate all forms of communication—AAC, speech, gestures, and expressions—and follow a Floortime-inspired approach that centers on meeting readers where they are and building joyful shared experiences. When applicable, a visual schedule will be emailed 24 hours before each session to help our readers follow along. Special thanks to Mary Pope Osborne and Penguin Random House for allowing us to read The Magic Tree House Merlin Missions: #4 Winter of the Ice Wizard in our virtual book club.",

We'll feature different titles and authors each month. Come and share your impressions, thoughts and interpretations of a book we have all read. This month we will be reading Normal People by Sally Rooney.\"Connell Waldron is one of the most popular boys in his small-town high school--he is a star of the football team, an excellent student, and never wanting for attention from girls. The one thing he doesn't have is money. Marianne Sheridan, a classmate of Connell's, has the opposite problem. Marianne is plain-looking, odd, and stubborn, and while her family is well-off, she has no friends to speak of. There is, however, a deep and undeniable connection between the two teenagers, one that develops into a secret relationship. Everything changes when both Connell and Marianne are accepted to Trinity College. Suddenly Marianne is well-liked and elegant, holding court with her intellectual friends while Connell hangs at the sidelines, not quite as fluent in language of the elite. Throughout their years at university, Marianne and Connell circle each other, falling in and out of romance but never straying far from where they started. And as Marianne experiments with an increasingly dangerous string of boyfriends, Connell must decide how far he is willing to go to save his oldest friend.\"Please login to your account with your library card and then register to reserve a copy of the book.",

Join the new Metro Year of the Book Club to read all of the monthly featured titles we are recommending this year, followed by a lively discussion of the book at the end of the month. We can't wait to meet you at the library! January's selection is The Library Book by Susan Orlean:In this lively and multilayered portrait of the Los Angeles Public Library by Orlean (The Orchid Thief), the author describes a source as \"electrified by everything he told me about the library.\" The same can be said for Orlean, whose enthusiasm and affection for the nearly 150-year-old institution is contagious. As in previous books and essays, Orlean assembles a panoramic profile from an array of fascinating details, from the library's earliest days as a reading room to its current thriving community presence as a provider of English classes, sheet -music for orchestras, services for the homeless, and more, including sketches of its charismatic-sometimes eccentric--directors, staff, and patrons. This sweeping, cheerful history revolves around a singular, terrible event: the 1986 fire that ravaged the Central Library, destroying some 400,000 books. Orlean's affecting account of the tragedy and its painful aftermath, as well as the many people it touched, points to a suspect who was never indicted. But the overall tone is warm and engaging, offering a love letter to libraries everywhere. VERDICT Orlean's fans, library lovers, and readers of eclectic nonfiction will enjoy this entertaining, informative account.",

Monday, January 26, 4:00 p.m. - Continuum: French Science Fiction Short Stories, ed. by Annabelle Dolidon, with Tessa Sermet.This unique collection of newly translated short stories offers a taste of classic and contemporary French science fiction to English-language readers. These stories cover a range of fascinating topics including simulated reality, speciesism, ecology, and transhumanism-all while exploring universal themes of belonging, death, and identity. Some of the authors featured in this anthology, like Julia Verlanger, Sylvie Denis, or Jean-Claude Dunyach, have shaped the history of French science fiction after World War II. Curated by Annabelle Dolidon and Tessa Sermet, French language and literature professors who share a love for the genre, these nine stories showcase some of the brilliant mid- to late twentieth century and twentieth century French contributions to science fiction. Dolidon and Sermet provide illuminating expansions that accompany each tale and fascinating insights into the evolution of French and American science fiction. This anthology is a great opportunity to discover French sci-fi in English translation for fans or readers new to the genre.Monday, February, 23, 2026, 4:00 p.m. TBDMonday, March 23, 2026, 4:00 p.m. TBDMonday, April 27, 2026, 4:00 p.m. TBDMonday, May 18, 2026, 4:00 p.m. TBDMonday, June 22, 2026, 4:00 p.m. TBDMonday, July 27, 2026, 4:00 p.m. TBDMonday, August 24, 2026, 4:00 p.m. TBDMonday, September 28, 2026, 4:00 p.m. TBDMonday, October 26, 2026, 4:00 p.m. TBDMonday, November 23, 2026, 4:00 p.m. TBDMonday, December 14, 2026, 4:00 p.m. TBD ADA Accommodation Requests",

Join us every third Monday of the month to discuss the novellas and short story collections of award-winning sci-fi authors. Through this Spring's offerings of stories, readers will explore a range of topics, from androids to first contact, and from post-apocalyptic to Afrofuturism. Registered participants are welcome to pick up their copies of this month’s book at Divoll.For our very first novella, we’re reading All Systems Red, the first installment of Martha Wells’ Murderbot Diaries. After overriding its control module, Murderbot becomes a free agent. Not knowing what to do with its newly found freewill–beyond binge watching its favorite show–Murderbot pretends to be a security unit for a group of hippy space scientists. But keeping them alive on an alien planet proves to be harder than expected.For accessibility accommodations, please call 314-241-2288.",

But The Great War intervenes in Maisie’s plans, and soon after commencement of her studies at Girton College, Cambridge, Maisie enlists for nursing service overseas.Years later, in 1929, having apprenticed to the renowned Maurice Blanche, a man revered for his work with Scotland Yard, Maisie sets up her own business. Her first assignment, a seemingly tedious inquiry involving a case of suspected infidelity, takes her not only on the trail of a killer, but back to the war she had tried so hard to forget.\"We will be making Oatmeal Brown Betties to accompany our discussion of the book.

Whether you loved it, loathed it, or left it unfinished, we want to hear your take. Come share your impressions and connect with fellow readers! This week we will be reading Vera Wong's Unsolicited Advice for Murder by Jesse Q. Sutanto. \"Knives Out meets Kim's Convenience in this captivating mystery by Jesse Q. Sutanto, bestselling author of Dial A for Aunties. Vera Wong is a lonely little old lady-ah, lady of a certain age-who lives above her forgotten tea shop in the middle of San Francisco's Chinatown. Despite living alone, Vera is not needy, oh no. She likes nothing more than sipping on a good cup of Wulong and doing some healthy detective work on the Internet about what her college-aged son is up to. Then one morning, Vera trudges downstairs to find a curious thing-a dead man in the middle of her tea shop. In his outstretched hand, a flash drive. Vera doesn't know what comes over her, but after calling the cops like any good citizen would, she sort of . . . swipes the flash drive from the body and tucks it safely into the pocket of her apron. Why? Because Vera is sure she would do a better job than the police possibly could, because nobody sniffs out a wrongdoing quite like a suspicious Chinese mother with time on her hands. Vera knows the killer will be back for the flash drive; all she has to do is watch the increasing number of customers at her shop and figure out which one among them is the killer. What Vera does not expect is to form friendships with her customers and start to care for each and every one of them. As a protective mother hen, will she end up having to give one of her newfound chicks to the police?\"--Provided by publisher.",

This month we are discussing: A Gentleman in Moscow by Amor TowlesFrom the Publisher:In 1922, Count Alexander Rostov is deemed an unrepentant aristocrat by a Bolshevik tribunal, and is sentenced to house arrest in the Metropol, a grand hotel across the street from the Kremlin. Rostov, an indomitable man of erudition and wit, has never worked a day in his life, and must now live in an attic room while some of the most tumultuous decades in Russian history are unfolding outside the hotel’s doors. Unexpectedly, his reduced circumstances provide him entry into a much larger world of emotional discovery.Brimming with humor, a glittering cast of characters, and one beautifully rendered scene after another, this singular novel casts a spell as it relates the count’s endeavor to gain a deeper understanding of what it means to be a man of purpose.",

      "description": "Love watching true crime documentaries and tv shows? Can't get enough of true crime podcasts? This is a monthly book group focused on reading and discussing True Crime. Join us on Zoom to discuss Yellow Bird: Oil, Murder, and a Woman's Search for Justice in Indian Country by Sierra Crane Murdoch. Yellow Bird\"When Lissa Yellow Bird was released from prison in 2009, she found her home, the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in North Dakota, transformed by the Bakken oil boom. In her absence, the landscape had been altered beyond recognition, her tribal government swayed by corporate interests, and her community burdened by a surge in violence and addiction. Three years later, when Lissa learned that a young white oil worker, Kristopher “KC” Clarke, had disappeared from his reservation worksite, she became particularly concerned. No one knew where Clarke had gone, and few people were actively looking for him. Yellow Bird traces Lissa’s steps as she obsessively hunts for clues to Clarke’s disappearance. She navigates two worlds—that of her own tribe, changed by its newfound wealth, and that of the non-Native oilmen, down on their luck, who have come to find work on the heels of the economic recession. Her pursuit of Clarke is also a pursuit of redemption, as Lissa atones for her own crimes and reckons with generations of trauma. Yellow Bird is an exquisitely written, masterfully reported story about a search for justice and a remarkable portrait of a complex woman who is smart, funny, eloquent, compassionate, and—when it serves her cause—manipulative. Drawing on eight years of immersive investigation, Sierra Crane Murdoch has produced a profound examination of the legacy of systematic violence inflicted on a tribal nation and a tale of extraordinary healing.\" -From the publisher",

This title should be on shelves and ready to borrow approximately 5 weeks prior to the discussion date. Check with a staff member if you have questions on how to access a copy.Book Description\"When renowned painter Mira Novak arrives at Wadia hospital in Bombay after a miscarriage, she's expected to make a quick recovery, and her nurse, Sona, is excited to learn more about the vivacious artist who shares her half-Indian identity. Sona, yearning for a larger life, finds herself carried away by Mira's stories of her travels and exploits and is shocked by accounts of the many lovers the painter has left scattered throughout Europe. When Mira dies quite suddenly and mysteriously, Sona falls under suspicion, and her quiet life is upended. The key to proving Sona's innocence may lie in a cryptic note and four paintings Mira left in her care, sending the young woman on a mission to visit the painter's former friends and lovers across a tumultuous Europe teetering toward war. On the precipice of discovering her own identity, Sona learns that the painter's charming facade hid a far more complicated, troubled soul. \"--Provided by publisher.",

      "description": "Join us at Kobetich Branch to discuss a new book each month. This month we will be reading West with Giraffes by Lynda Rutledge. Please note our new meeting time of 4-5pm starting in January. An emotional, rousing novel inspired by the incredible true story of two giraffes who made headlines and won the hearts of Depression-era America. “Few true friends have I known and two were giraffes…” Woodrow Wilson Nickel, age 105, feels his life ebbing away. But when he learns giraffes are going extinct, he finds himself recalling the unforgettable experience he cannot take to his grave. It’s 1938. The Great Depression lingers. Hitler is threatening Europe, and world-weary Americans long for wonder. They find it in two giraffes who miraculously survive a hurricane while crossing the Atlantic. What follows is a twelve-day road trip in a custom truck to deliver Southern California’s first giraffes to the San Diego Zoo. Behind the wheel is the young Dust Bowl rowdy Woodrow. Inspired by true events, the tale weaves real-life figures with fictional ones, including the world’s first female zoo director, a crusty old man with a past, a young female photographer with a secret, and assorted reprobates as spotty as the giraffes. Part adventure, part historical saga, and part coming-of-age love story, West with Giraffes explores what it means to be changed by the grace of animals, the kindness of strangers, the passing of time, and a story told before it’s too late. The book is available for check out at the Kobetich circulation desk. The Kobetich Book Club meets on the last Wednesday of the month. New members are always welcome! Please call Kobetich library staff at 253-280-2921 for assistance with locating or reserving a copy.",

We'll feature different titles and authors each month. Come and share your impressions, thoughts and interpretations of a book we have all read.This month we will be reading Convenience Store Woman by Sayaka Murata.Convenience Store Woman is the heartwarming and surprising story of thirty-six-year-old Tokyo resident Keiko Furukura. Keiko has never fit in, neither in her family, nor in school, but when at the age of eighteen she begins working at the Hiiromachi branch of \"Smile Mart,\" she finds peace and purpose in her life. In the store, unlike anywhere else, she understands the rules of social interaction--many are laid out line by line in the store's manual--and she does her best to copy the dress, mannerisms, and speech of her colleagues, playing the part of a \"normal\" person excellently, more or less. Managers come and go, but Keiko stays at the store for eighteen years. It's almost hard to tell where the store ends and she begins. Keiko is very happy, but the people close to her, from her family to her coworkers, increasingly pressure her to find a husband, and to start a proper career, prompting her to take desperate action... A brilliant depiction of an unusual psyche and a world hidden from view, Convenience Store Woman is an ironic and sharp-eyed look at contemporary work culture and the pressures to conform, as well as a charming and completely fresh portrait of an unforgettable heroine.",

      "description": "TPL'S ONLINE SPECULATIVE FICTION BOOK GROUP! Regularly meets the last Wednesday of each month via Zoom to discuss intriguing, mind-expanding books from multiple genres. Register today and join us online. January 2026 Selection: Hyperion by Dan Simmons The first novel in Dan Simmons' critically acclaimed, award-winning Hyperion Cantos series. Considered a classic of 20th Century science fiction. On the world called Hyperion, beyond the reach of galactic law, waits a creature called the Shrike. There are those who worship it. There are those who fear it. And there are those who have vowed to destroy it. In the Valley of the Time Tombs, where huge, brooding structures move backward through time, the Shrike waits for them all. On the eve of Armageddon, with the entire galaxy at war, seven pilgrims set forth on a final voyage to Hyperion seeking the answers to the unsolved riddles of their lives. Each carries a desperate hope—and a terrible secret. And one may hold the fate of humanity in his hands. \"Mr. Simmons shuttles his characters through space and time with the enviable freedom that modern science fiction accords the untimid storyteller. He surrounds them with marvels of technology that they tend to take for granted, just as we do when we flick on a light switch or turn the ignition key in our car. These people are not scientists; they are less interested in comprehending or controlling the universe than in answering the question posed by all fiction that aspires to the status of literature: what does it mean to be human?\" — The New York Times Hyperion If all physical copies are checked out, additional eBook copies may be available in Libby/OverDrive Speculative Fiction? What's that? Do you like science fiction? That's speculative fiction. Fantasy? OK, that's speculative fiction too. Horror, magical realism, alternate history, slipstream, steampunk, cyberpunk, dystopias, apocalyptic tales, and stories that are just plain weird? Yep. Those are all eligible for our speculative fiction menu!If reading outside the lines of everyday life interests you, we invite you to join our online community as we explore our reading horizons. Other Worlds might be the change of pace you're looking for.",

There they must overcome their fears and solve the Ice Wizard’s riddle, because if Jack and Annie don’t complete their mission in time, Merlin and Morgan will disappear forever! This book will be read in three parts on January 15, 22, and 29. About Our Book Club: Each week, an AAC user hosts our sessions, and a librarian reads our story. After each reading, we enjoy an activity or game connected to the book, celebrating representation, creativity, and the many wonderful ways people communicate. We celebrate all forms of communication—AAC, speech, gestures, and expressions—and follow a Floortime-inspired approach that centers on meeting readers where they are and building joyful shared experiences. When applicable, a visual schedule will be emailed 24 hours before each session to help our readers follow along. Special thanks to Mary Pope Osborne and Penguin Random House for allowing us to read The Magic Tree House Merlin Missions: #4 Winter of the Ice Wizard in our virtual book club.",

The Murderbot Diaries Vol 1 description:On a distant planet, a team of scientists are conducting surface tests, shadowed by their Company-supplied ‘droid ― a self-aware SecUnit that has hacked its own governor module, and refers to itself (though never out loud) as “Murderbot.” Scornful of humans, all it really wants is to be left alone long enough to figure out who it is (and to watch its favorite show in its downtime.) But when a neighboring mission goes dark, it’s up to the scientists and Murderbot to get to the truth.",

Read this month's selection, drop in and join the fun! For February 3 the club will be discussing The Chestnut Man by Søren Sveistrup. SynopsisOn the first Tuesday in October, Rosa Hartung is returning to her job as minister for social affairs following a year's leave of absence--granted after the dramatic disappearance of her twelve-year-old daughter. Linus Bekker, a mentally ill young man, confessed to her killing, but is unable to remember where he buried the various parts of her dismembered corpse, leaving Rosa with no choice but to try to move on without closure. The same day Rosa returns to parliament, a young single mother is found brutally murdered at her home in the suburbs of Copenhagen--she's been tortured, and one hand has been cut off. Thulin and Hess, the detectives sent to investigate the crime, arrive at the address to find a figure made of chestnuts hanging from a playhouse nearby. When yet another woman is murdered--this time with both hands cut off--and another chestnut figure is found, Thulin and Hess begin to suspect a connection to the Hartung case. To put an end to the killing spree, the pair, with nothing in common aside from equally troubled personal lives, realize they will need to put aside their differences in a race against time--and a brutal psychopath.The Chestnut Man Library staff may take photos, videos, or audio recordings at our events. Please tell us if you do not wish to be photographed, video-recorded, or audio-recorded. We will always respect your requests! An ASL (American Sign Language) interpreter or closed captioning can be provided for this program if requested at least seven (7) days in advance.

Upon its rooftops and among the shadows of its cobbled streets wait the Gatherers - the keepers of this peace. Priests of the dream-goddess, their duty is to harvest the magic of the sleeping mind and use it to heal, soothe...and kill those judged corrupt.But when a conspiracy blooms within Gujaareh's great temple, the Gatherer Ehiru must question everything he knows. Someone, or something, is murdering innocent dreamers in the goddess's name, and Ehiru must now protect the woman he was sent to kill - or watch the city be devoured by war and forbidden magic.\"",

Next Chapter Book Club offers community-based book clubs for adolescents and adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Our members (including some who cannot read) love the way books transport them to different worlds where they meet interesting characters and learn about exciting new things. Taking that journey with a group of friends makes it even more delightful and fun. Join us online (click this link to connect to the virtual book club) Wednesdays 5-6 pm until we reach the end of the book. Estimated end date in March. Contact Erin at erin.zolotukhin-ridgway@ci.stpaul.mn.us with questions. This book will be shared online during book club.",

The Caribbean Sea, 1675. Jacquotte Delahaye is the mixed-race daughter of a wealthy tavern owner on the island of Tortuga. Instead of marriage, Jacquotte dreams of joining the seafarers and smugglers whose tall-masted ships cluster in the turquoise waters around Tortuga. In Haiti she becomes Jacques, a dockworker, earning the respect of those around her while hiding her gender. Jacquotte discovers that secret identities are fairly common in the chaotic world of seafaring, which is full of outsiders and misfits. As Jacques, Jacquotte falls in love with Lizzôa d'Erville, a beautiful courtesan who deals in secrets and sex. While others see their work clothes as a disguise, Lizzôa’s true self is as a woman. For the next twenty years, Jacquotte raids the Caribbean, making enemies and amassing a fortune in stolen gold. When her fellow pirates decide to increase their profits by entering the slave trade, Jacquotte turns away from piracy and the pursuit of riches. Risking her life in one deadly skirmish after another, she instead begins to plot a war of liberation. Don’t miss out on this exciting discussion!

      "description": "Vanessa Riley delves into Fire Sword and Sea, her newest novel inspired by the legendary pirate Jacquotte Delahaye. Set in the Caribbean of 1675, the story follows Jacquotte as she rejects the life expected of her and disguises herself as “Jacques,” a dockworker who earns respect while concealing her identity. Amid the chaotic world of smugglers and seafarers, she forms deep connections, including a powerful bond with Lizzôa d’Erville, a courtesan who lives her own truth in a world of secrets. Over the next two decades, Jacquotte becomes a feared and successful pirate, amassing wealth and enemies across the Caribbean. But when her crew turns to the slave trade, she refuses to participate and instead risks everything to fight for liberation, transforming her life of piracy into a mission for justice.This program is part of Santa Clara County Library District's celebration of Silicon Valley Reads. --- The free, virtual series is open to the public and takes place two to three times a month.

We will introduce Volume 1 of a series to get you started on your next reading adventure. We encourage teens to read at least Volume 1, whether that is a physical copy from your own manga collection, from our library, or borrowed from a friend. Digital reading also counts; we will be happy to have you participate in our discussion if you have read an e-copy. Physical copies of Volume 1 will be available for in person pick-up at the Enon Branch on a first come, first served basis. Check out Libby and Hoopla for available digital copies. Scheduled for the second Monday of the month. For teens. This month's selection: Fall in Love You False Angels by Coco Uzuki Summary: All sugar, no spice, and everything nice...that's the impression the beautiful first-year high schooler and class president Otogi gives to those around her. One look from the school's \"heartthrob angel\" is all it takes to sweep countless admirers off their feet. But the real Otogi Katsura is no angel: She's calculating, ruthless, and sharp-tongued. When Otogi slips up and exposes her inner baddie in front of the class's other paragon, Toki, he counters by revealing an unexpected side of his own and declaring her his \"partner in crime.\" With cupid's arrow at her back, can the \"heartthrob angel\" maintain her perfect act and regain the upper hand, or will she be the one swept off her feet by a fellow false angel?!” Rated 13 +",

      "description": "The Minnesota History Center is showcasing a number of unique items from the MNHS collections in an exhibit entitled “The Stories We Keep.” This exhibit features 25 objects from MNHS collections—a rich trove built on the generosity and foresight of thousands of people who have entrusted MNHS with their belongings and their stories. To celebrate the exhibit, the History Center has partnered with the Saint Paul Public Library to host a book club featuring Precious and Adored by Lizzie Ehrenhalt and Tilly Laskey. Precious and Adored highlights the correspondence between Rose Cleveland, sister of President Grover Cleveland, and Evangeline Simpson, a wealthy widow who would become the second wife of Henry Whipple, Minnesota's Episcopal bishop. The women corresponded across states and continents, discussing their advocacy and humanitarian work - and demonstrating their sexual attraction, romance, and partnership. Participate in the book club to learn more about this portrayal of nineteenth-century LGBTQ history, then visit “The Stories We Keep” to see original letters from the MNHS collections. Participation in this book club includes a copy of the book and two free passes to the Minnesota History Center to see the exhibit. This book club is for adults.",

      "description": "Join us to celebrate the love of reading with others in our community! This month's selection is Mrs. Dalloway by Virginia Woolf. Heralded as Virginia Woolf's greatest novel, this is a vivid portrait of a single day in a woman's life. When we meet her, Mrs. Clarissa Dalloway is preoccupied with the last-minute details of party preparation while in her mind she is something much more than a perfect society hostess. As she readies her house, she is flooded with remembrances of faraway times. And, met with the realities of the present, Clarissa reexamines the choices that brought her there, hesitantly looking ahead to the unfamiliar work of growing old. Visit the following link to view all of Lynnwood Library Book Group's 2026 selections: Lynnwood Library Book Club 2026 Titles. Books are selected by members of the group and cover a variety of genres. The Lynnwood Library Book Group meets regularly on the second Monday of each month from 6:30-7:45pm.

      "description": "The Page Turners is an evening book discussion group for adults that meets at the Castro Valley Library on the second Tuesday of the month at 7 pm. Facilitated by librarian Chris Selig, the discussions focus on compelling, well-reviewed fiction and nonfiction books written for adults.For February we will discuss James by Percival Everett, which is available for check out through the Library collection and Link Plus. Synopsis James, is a retelling of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, that is harrowing, ferociously funny and told from the enslaved Jim's point of view. When the enslaved Jim overhears that he is about to be sold to a man in New Orleans, separated from his wife and daughter forever, he decides to hide on nearby Jackson Island until he can formulate a plan. Meanwhile, Huck Finn has faked his own death to escape his violent father, recently returned to town. As all readers of American literature know, thus begins the dangerous and transcendent journey by raft down the Mississippi River toward the elusive and too-often-unreliable promise of the Free States and beyond. While many narrative set pieces of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn remain in place (floods and storms, stumbling across both unexpected death and unexpected treasure in the myriad stopping points along the river's banks, encountering the scam artists posing as the Duke and Dauphin...), Jim's agency, intelligence and compassion are shown in a radically new light.James _________ An ASL (American Sign Language) interpreter can be provided for this program if requested at least seven business days in advance.

About the book:One Foot in the Grape is a cozy mystery about ex-photojournalist Penny Lively, who inherits a California winery, only to get tangled in murder when her neighbor's wine is sabotaged and a staff member ends up dead in a grape crusher, making her niece the prime suspect, forcing Penny to solve the crime before her family is ruined.

Next Chapter Book Club offers community-based book clubs for adolescents and adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Our members (including some who cannot read) love the way books transport them to different worlds where they meet interesting characters and learn about exciting new things. Taking that journey with a group of friends makes it even more delightful and fun. Join us online (click this link to connect to the virtual book club) Wednesdays 5-6 pm until we reach the end of the book. Estimated end date in March.

Each month we'll read a book set in a different country then enjoy conversations about the book as well as other cultures and experiences. We'll read from multiple categories, including fiction, nonfiction, graphic novels, novels in verse, and more. This month we'll be reading and discussing Amal Unbound by Aisha Saeed and set in Pakistan. Please register then stop by the library for a free copy of the book no earlier than one month before the discussion.\"Twelve-year-old Amal's dream of becoming a teacher one day is dashed in an instant when she accidentally insults a member of her Pakistani village's ruling family. As punishment for her behavior, she is forced to leave her heartbroken family behind and go work at their estate. Amal is distraught but has faced setbacks before. So she summons her courage and begins navigating the complex rules of life as a servant, with all its attendant jealousies and pecking-order woes. Most troubling, though, is Amal's increasing awareness of the deadly measures the Khan family will go to in order to stay in control. It's clear that their hold over her village will never loosen as long as everyone is too afraid to challenge them--so if Amal is to have any chance of ensuring her loved ones' safety and winning back her freedom, she must find a way to work with the other servants to make it happen.\" Amal Unbound An ASL (American Sign Language) interpreter can be provided for this program if requested at least seven (7) business days in advance.

Book discussions usually include issues related to social justice, equity, and anti-racism.

Everyone is welcome to attend whether or not you have read the selected book for that meeting. This is a drop-in event, and February 12 is our first book club meeting in 2026. We gather in person at the Fairfax Library for this conversation.We will be discussing our selection: On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous by Ocean Vuong On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous is a letter from a son to a mother who cannot read. Written when the speaker, Little Dog, is in his late twenties, the letter unearths a family's history that began before he was born -- a history whose epicenter is rooted in Vietnam -- and serves as a doorway into parts of his life his mother has never known, all of it leading to an unforgettable revelation. At once a witness to the fraught yet undeniable love between a single mother and her son, it is also a brutally honest exploration of race, class, and masculinity.

This title should be on shelves and ready to borrow approximately 5 weeks prior to the discussion date. Check with a staff member if you have questions on how to access a copy.Book Description\"A dazzling debut that asks: Can a name shape the course of a life? In the wake of an enormous, history-making storm, Cora sets off with her nine-year-old daughter, Maia, to register her son's birth. Her husband Gordon, a local doctor, respected in the community but a terrifying and controlling presence at home, intends for her to follow his family tradition going back generations, and name the child Gordon. But on the journey there, Cora wonders if it's right to impose the burden of this name and its legacy onto her tiny newborn son. She herself has Julian in mind, and Maia offers up her own suggestion: Bear. What follows are three alternate and alternating versions of both Cora's life and her young son's life shaped by her brave, last-minute choice of name. Spanning thirty-five years, the novel draws us in from the first page, as we follow three unforgettable journeys of one young man, but also his mother, grandmother, and sister. In richly layered prose, The Names explores the painful ripple effects of domestic abuse, the messy ties of family, and the possibilities of autonomy and healing.\"--Provided by publisher.",

This title should be on shelves and ready to borrow approximately 5 weeks prior to the discussion date. Check with a staff member if you have questions on how to access a copy.Book Description\"In a near-future Kolkata beset by flooding and blight, Ma, her two year old daughter Mishti, and her elderly father Dadu are just days from leaving the collapsing city behind to join Ma's husband in the home he has been building for them in Ann Arbor, Michigan. After procuring long-awaited passports and visas from the consulate, they pack their bags for the flight to America. But in the morning they awaken to discover that Ma's purse, with all the treasured documents within it, has been stolen. A Guardian and a Thief tells two stories: the story of Ma and her family, their struggle to emigrate to America, and their devastation in the wake of the theft that changes their fate to one of implacable tragedy; and Boomba, the thief, whose hunger and desperation to care for his family drive him to commit a crime whose consequences he cannot fathom. With stunning control and command, Megha Majumdar paints a kaleidoscopic portrait of two families whose destinies become inexorably entangled, wresting compassion from each narrative as the complexities of each character's circumstances-their helplessness in the face of poverty and corruption, and the need to stave off encroaching catastrophe--are captured with clarity and piercing empathy. A masterful new work from one of the most exciting voices of her generation\"--Provided by publisher.",

      "description": "The Minnesota History Center is showcasing a number of unique items from the MNHS collections in an exhibit entitled “The Stories We Keep.” This exhibit features 25 objects from MNHS collections—a rich trove built on the generosity and foresight of thousands of people who have entrusted MNHS with their belongings and their stories. To celebrate the exhibit, the History Center has partnered with the Saint Paul Public Library to host a book club featuring Precious and Adored by Lizzie Ehrenhalt and Tilly Laskey. Precious and Adored highlights the correspondence between Rose Cleveland, sister of President Grover Cleveland, and Evangeline Simpson, a wealthy widow who would become the second wife of Henry Whipple, Minnesota's Episcopal bishop. The women corresponded across states and continents, discussing their advocacy and humanitarian work - and demonstrating their sexual attraction, romance, and partnership. Participate in the book club to learn more about this portrayal of nineteenth-century LGBTQ history, then visit “The Stories We Keep” to see original letters from the MNHS collections. Participation in this book club includes a copy of the book and two free passes to the Minnesota History Center to see the exhibit. This book club is for adults.",

      "description": "The record-breaking author of Goosebumps and Fear Street discusses his ever-expanding body of work with horror expert Becky Spratford. This event is made possible by Illinois Libraries Present. Program presented virtually via Zoom. This event is made possible by Illinois Libraries Present (ILP), a statewide collaboration among public libraries offering premier events. ILP is funded in part by a grant awarded by the Illinois State Library, a department of the Office of Secretary of State, using funds provided by the U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Services, under the provisions of the Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA). More about the author: Witty, creepy, and compulsively readable, bestselling author R.L. Stine defined horror for a generation of young readers. The generation that grew up with the Goosebumps franchise may be grown, but Stine keeps finding ways to keep us afraid of the dark!

Since the fall of 2016, Saint Paul Public Library has been a Next Chapter Book Club affiliate. Next Chapter Book Club offers community-based book clubs for adolescents and adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Our members (including some who cannot read) love the way books transport them to different worlds where they meet interesting characters and learn about exciting new things. Taking that journey with a group of friends makes it even more delightful and fun. Join us online (click this link to connect to the virtual book club) Wednesdays 5-6 pm until we reach the end of the book. Estimated end date in March. Contact Erin at erin.zolotukhin-ridgway@ci.stpaul.mn.us with questions. This book will be shared online during book club.",

      "description": "Join us at Kobetich Branch to discuss a new book each month. This month we will be reading The Ministry of Time by Kaliane Bradley.NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLERA GOOD MORNING AMERICA BOOK CLUB PICK“This summer’s hottest debut.” —Cosmopolitan “Witty, sexy escapist fiction [that] packs a substantial punch...Fresh and thrilling.” —Los Angeles Times “Electric...I loved every second.” —Emily Henry“Utterly winning...Imagine if The Time Traveler’s Wife had an affair with A Gentleman in Moscow...Readers, I envy you: There’s a smart, witty novel in your future.” —Ron Charles, The Washington PostA time travel romance, a spy thriller, a workplace comedy, and an ingenious exploration of the nature of power and the potential for love to change it all: Welcome to The Ministry of Time, the exhilarating debut novel by Kaliane Bradley.In the near future, a civil servant is offered the salary of her dreams and is, shortly afterward, told what project she’ll be working on. A recently established government ministry is gathering “expats” from across history to establish whether time travel is feasible—for the body, but also for the fabric of space-time.She is tasked with working as a “bridge”: living with, assisting, and monitoring the expat known as “1847” or Commander Graham Gore. As far as history is concerned, Commander Gore died on Sir John Franklin’s doomed 1845 expedition to the Arctic, so he’s a little disoriented to be living with an unmarried woman who regularly shows her calves, surrounded by outlandish concepts such as “washing machines,” “Spotify,” and “the collapse of the British Empire.” But with an appetite for discovery, a seven-a-day cigarette habit, and the support of a charming and chaotic cast of fellow expats, he soon adjusts.Over the next year, what the bridge initially thought would be, at best, a horrifically uncomfortable roommate dynamic, evolves into something much deeper. By the time the true shape of the Ministry’s project comes to light, the bridge has fallen haphazardly, fervently in love, with consequences she never could have imagined. Forced to confront the choices that brought them together, the bridge must finally reckon with how—and whether she believes—what she does next can change the future.An exquisitely original and feverishly fun fusion of genres and ideas, The Ministry of Time asks: What does it mean to defy history, when history is living in your house? Kaliane Bradley’s answer is a blazing, unforgettable testament to what we owe each other in a changing world.The book is available for check out at the Kobetich circulation desk. The Kobetich Book Club meets on the last Wednesday of the month. New members are always welcome! Please call Kobetich library staff at 253-280-2921 for assistance with locating or reserving a copy.",

But he can sense the beating heart of the city, see its history, and feel its power.In the Bronx, a Lenape gallery director discovers strange graffiti scattered throughout the city, so beautiful and powerful it's as if the paint is literally calling to her. In Brooklyn, a politician and mother finds she can hear the songs of her city, pulsing to the beat of her Louboutin heels. And they're not the only ones. Every great city has a soul. Some are ancient as myths, and others are as new and destructive as children. New York? She's got six. The City We Became Speculative Fiction? What's that? Do you like science fiction? That's speculative fiction. Fantasy? OK, that's speculative fiction too.

For more information and a Zoom invite, contact Davo Knepler at nuevodavos@yahoo.com.We will be discussing The Last Dekrepitzer by Howard Langer. The author will be joining us for the discussion. WINNER NATIONAL JEWISH BOOK AWARD The fiddler busking in the Columbus Circle subway station in 1965 is the Dekrepitzer Rebbe, the sole survivor of the obscure Dekrepitzer Hasidic sect known before the war for its rebbes' fiddling. The Last Dekrepitzer follows the life and spiritual quest of Shmuel Meir Lichtbencher a/k/a Sam Lightup, from his isolated shtetl in the mountains of southern Poland, where he is brought up to be the future rebbe, to the wharves in Naples, where he jams with Black soldiers waiting to ship home at the end of the war. Dressing him in the uniform and dog tags of an AWOL soldier, they smuggle him home to rural Mississippi. He lives for years among the Blacks, speaks Black English, preaches and plays the blues with the Brown Sugar Ramblers trio. His marriage to a Black woman, Lula Curtin, legal by Jewish law though forbidden under Mississippi law, results in a cross burning that forces them to flee to Manhattan. He plays on the streets of Harlem and Midtown with the Reverend Gary Davis, the great blind guitarist whose mission is saving souls for the next world. Shmuel Meir's devout wife, though she knows herself to be the Dekrepitzer Rebbitzen, is spurned by the Jewish community. Through it all, Shmuel Meir fiddles his prayers in defiance of God. But God gives the Dekrepitzer Rebbe no peace.For more information and a Zoom invite, contact Davo Knepler at nuevodavos@yahoo.com. Everyone is welcome to attend.

      "description": "You’re invited to join us for a virtual conversation with acclaimed author Kate Quinn about her latest fantastical work, The Astral Library, which poses the question: Have you ever wished you could live inside a book? Welcome to the Astral Library, where books are not just objects, but doors to new worlds, new lives, and new futures. Alexandria “Alix” Watson has learned one lesson from her barren childhood in the foster-care system: unlike people, books will never let you down. Working three dead-end jobs to make ends meet, Alix takes nightly refuge in the high-vaulted reading room at the Boston Public Library, escaping into her favorite fantasy novels. Until the day she stumbles through a hidden door and meets the Librarian: the ageless, acerbic guardian of a hidden library where the desperate and the lost escape to new lives...inside their favorite books. The Librarian takes a dazzled Alix under her wing, but before she can escape into the pages of her new life, a shadowy enemy emerges to threaten everyone the Astral Library has ever helped protect. Aided by a dashing costume-shop owner, Alix and the Librarian flee through the Regency drawing rooms of Jane Austen to the back alleys of Sherlock Holmes and the champagne-soaked parties of The Great Gatsby as danger draws inexorably closer. But who does their enemy really wish to destroy—Alix, the Librarian, or the Library itself? About the Author: Kate Quinn is the New York Times and USA Today bestselling author of historical fiction. A native of Southern California, she attended Boston University, where she earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees in classical voice. A lifelong history buff, she has written four novels in the Empress of Rome Saga and two books set in the Italian Renaissance before turning to the 20th century with The Alice Network, The Huntress, The Rose Code, The Diamond Eye, and The Briar Club. The Astral Library is her first foray into magic realism. She and her husband now live in Maryland with their rescue dogs.This program is funded by the Sno-Isle Libraries Foundation.

So, Josiah heads to the shipyard to find work as a riveter, fastening together the ribs and steel plates of Victory ships. One night, Josiah spots Poppy singing at a navy club. Despite their different backgrounds, they fall for each other instantly and begin a starry-eyed romance that lasts until the harsh reality of their situation is made clear. Determined to prove himself, Josiah takes a train to Toronto where he’s finally given the chance to enlist. After volunteering for the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion and jumping into Normandy on D-Day, he must fight through the battlefields of Europe to make it back to the woman he loves. By turns harrowing and exhilarating, The Riveter explores what one man must sacrifice to belong to the only country he has ever called home.\" -- Provided by Publisher",

      "description": "Want to connect with others over the love of reading? Join our book club to discuss Robert Macfarlane's Is a River Alive? This title should be on shelves and ready to borrow approximately 5 weeks prior to the discussion date. Check with a staff member if you have questions on how to access a copy.Book Description\"From the celebrated nature writer, observer and advocate Robert Macfarlane, a brilliant, immersive and paradigm-shifting book that says an emphatic yes to the question it asks. Robert Macfarlane writes, \"At the heart of Is A River Alive? is a single, powerful idea: that rivers, forests, glaciers and mountains are living beings, and that as such they have rights that should be recognized both in imagination and in law. The river has the right to flow unimpeded to the sea; the old-growth forest the right not to be felled; the mountain the right not to be disembowelled for coal.\" This idea -- known as the Rights of Nature -- is driving a conceptual and legal revolution, largely led by Indigenous and non-white activists who are succeeding at challenging the Western legal system to think beyond the idea of nature as material for humans to exploit to a future where regarding all of nature as a living entity may ensure our survival. The book flows like water, from the mountains to the sea, following three major journeys Macfarlane undertakes with local activists: to Ecuador where a recent court decision protects the ancient cedars of the cloud forests from Canadian mining activity; to India, where the fight to revive rivers that start in the glaciers of the Himalayas and empty into the ocean and polluted lagoons of Chennai is not yet won; and to northeastern Quebec where in 2021 an alliance between the local Innu nation and the regional municipal council declared the Mutehekau (Magpie) River a living being, with legal rights. Along with the voices of his fellow travellers, Macfarlane's own voice and incomparable gifts of expression carry immeasurable power to open hearts, spark conversations and challenge perspectives, making Is A River Alive? not only a wondrous literary experience but a powerful rallying cry in the environmental justice movement\"--Provided by publisher.",

This title should be on shelves and ready to borrow approximately 5 weeks prior to the discussion date. Check with a staff member if you have questions on how to access a copy.Book Description\"Beth and her gentle, kind husband Frank are happily married, but their relationship relies on the past staying buried. But when Beth’s brother-in-law shoots a dog going after their sheep, Beth doesn’t realize that the gunshot will alter the course of their lives. For the dog belonged to none other than Gabriel Wolfe, the man Beth loved as a teenager—the man who broke her heart years ago. Gabriel has returned to the village with his young son Leo, a boy who reminds Beth very much of her own son, who died in a tragic accident.As Beth is pulled back into Gabriel’s life, tensions around the village rise and dangerous secrets and jealousies from the past resurface, this time with deadly consequences. Beth is forced to make a choice between the woman she once was, and the woman she has become.A sweeping love story with the pace and twists of a thriller, Broken Country is a novel of simmering passion, impossible choices, and explosive consequences that toggles between the past and present to explore the far-reaching legacy of first love.\" --Provided by publisher.",

      "description": "Join us at Kobetich Branch to discuss a new book each month. This month we will be reading Rough Trade by Katrina Carrasco. Lambda Literary Award Winner, 2025 Finalist for the Edgar Award for Best Novel Named a Best Crime Novel of the Year byThe New York Times and a Best Book of the Year by The New Yorker and AutostraddleAlma Rosales is back and trouble is hot on her heels in this thrilling, queer historical novel from the critically acclaimed author of The Best Bad Things.Washington Territory, 1888. With contacts on the docks and in the railroad and a buyer’s market funneling product their way, ex-detective Alma Rosales and her opium-smuggling crew are making a fortune. They spend their days moving crates and their nights at the Monte Carlo, the center of Tacoma’s queer scene, where skirts and trousers don’t signify and everyone’s free to suit themselves. And Alma, who is living as a hardscrabble stevedore called Jack Camp, knows this most of all.When two local men end up dead, all signs point to the opium trade. A botched effort to disappear the bodies draws the attention of lawmen, and although Alma scrambles to keep them away from her operation, she’s distracted by the surprise appearance of Bess Spencer―an ex-Pinkerton agent and Alma’s first love―after years of silence. Then a handsome young stranger, Ben Velásquez, rolls into town and falls into an affair with one of Alma’s crewmen. When Ben starts asking questions about opium, Alma begins to suspect she has welcomed a spy into her inner circle, and she’s forced to consider how far she’ll go to protect her trade.Katrina Carrasco plunges readers into the vivid, rough-and-tumble world of the late-1800s Pacific Northwest in this genre and gender-blurring novel. Rough Trade follows Carrasco’s critically acclaimed debut, The Best Bad Things, and reimagines queer communities, the turbulent early days of modern media and medicine, and the pleasures―and price―of satisfying desire. The book is available for check out at the Kobetich circulation desk. The Kobetich Book Club meets on the last Wednesday of the month. New members are always welcome! Please call Kobetich library staff at 253-280-2921 for assistance with locating or reserving a copy.",

Register today and join us online. March 2026 Selection: The Rook by Daniel O'Malley Book one of the urban fantasy / paranormal thriller series The Rook Files. \"The body you are wearing used to be mine.\" So begins the letter Myfanwy [rhymes with Tiffany] Thomas is holding when she awakes in a London park surrounded by bodies all wearing latex gloves. With no recollection of who she is, Myfanwy must follow the instructions her former self left behind to discover her identity and track down the agents who want to destroy her. She soon learns that she is a Rook, a high-ranking member of a secret organization called the Chequy [CHECK-eye] that battles the many supernatural forces at work in Britain. She also discovers that she possesses a rare, potentially deadly supernatural ability of her own. In her quest to uncover which member of the Chequy betrayed her and why, Myfanwy encounters a person with four bodies, an aristocratic woman who can enter her dreams, a secret training facility where children are transformed into deadly fighters, and a conspiracy more vast than she ever could have imagined. \"Adroitly straddles the thin line between fantasy, thriller, and spoof....O'Malley is a nimble writer, effortlessly leaping back and forth between comedy and action.\" — David Pitt, Booklist The Rook Speculative Fiction?

This month's selection: Witch Hat Atelier by Kamome Shirahama Summary: In a world where everyone takes wonders like magic spells and dragons for granted, Coco is a girl with a simple dream: She wants to be a witch. But everybody knows magicians are born, not made, and Coco was not born with a gift for magic. Resigned to her un-magical life, Coco is about to give up on her dream to become a witch...until the day she meets Qifrey, a mysterious, traveling magician. After secretly seeing Qifrey perform magic in a way she's never seen before, Coco soon learns what everybody \"knows\" might not be the truth, and discovers that her magical dream may not be as far away as it may seem...” Rated 13 +",

Within the labyrinth of halls an ocean is imprisoned; waves thunder up staircases; rooms are flooded in an instant. But Piranesi is not afraid; he understands the tides as he understands the pattern of the labyrinth itself.

Check with a staff member if you have questions on how to access a copy.Book Description\"In a near-future Kolkata beset by flooding and blight, Ma, her two year old daughter Mishti, and her elderly father Dadu are just days from leaving the collapsing city behind to join Ma's husband in the home he has been building for them in Ann Arbor, Michigan. After procuring long-awaited passports and visas from the consulate, they pack their bags for the flight to America. But in the morning they awaken to discover that Ma's purse, with all the treasured documents within it, has been stolen. A Guardian and a Thief tells two stories: the story of Ma and her family, their struggle to emigrate to America, and their devastation in the wake of the theft that changes their fate to one of implacable tragedy; and Boomba, the thief, whose hunger and desperation to care for his family drive him to commit a crime whose consequences he cannot fathom. With stunning control and command, Megha Majumdar paints a kaleidoscopic portrait of two families whose destinies become inexorably entangled, wresting compassion from each narrative as the complexities of each character's circumstances-their helplessness in the face of poverty and corruption, and the need to stave off encroaching catastrophe--are captured with clarity and piercing empathy. A masterful new work from one of the most exciting voices of her generation\"--Provided by publisher.",

This title should be on shelves and ready to borrow approximately 5 weeks prior to the discussion date. Check with a staff member if you have questions on how to access a copy.Book Description\"A dazzling debut that asks: Can a name shape the course of a life? In the wake of an enormous, history-making storm, Cora sets off with her nine-year-old daughter, Maia, to register her son's birth. Her husband Gordon, a local doctor, respected in the community but a terrifying and controlling presence at home, intends for her to follow his family tradition going back generations, and name the child Gordon. But on the journey there, Cora wonders if it's right to impose the burden of this name and its legacy onto her tiny newborn son. She herself has Julian in mind, and Maia offers up her own suggestion: Bear. What follows are three alternate and alternating versions of both Cora's life and her young son's life shaped by her brave, last-minute choice of name. Spanning thirty-five years, the novel draws us in from the first page, as we follow three unforgettable journeys of one young man, but also his mother, grandmother, and sister. In richly layered prose, The Names explores the painful ripple effects of domestic abuse, the messy ties of family, and the possibilities of autonomy and healing.\"--Provided by publisher.",

Register today and join us online.April 2026 Selection:Ocean's Godori by Elaine U. ChoExciting, fresh and unique perspective science fiction from a rising Seattle writer.Ocean Yoon has never felt very Korean, even if she is descended from a long line of haenyeo, Jeju Island's beloved female divers. She doesn't like soju, constantly misses cultural references, and despite her love of the game, people still say that she doesn't play Hwatu like a Korean. Ocean's also persona non grata at the Alliance, Korea's solar system-dominating space agency, since a mission went awry and she earned a reputation for being a little too quick with her gun. When her best friend, Teo, second son of the Anand Tech empire, is framed for murdering his family, Ocean and her misfit crewmates are pushed to the forefront of a high-stakes ideological conflict. But dodging bullets and winning space chases may be the easiest part of what comes next.“Ocean’s Godori navigates the space lane blazed by Becky Chambers and James S.A. Corey, but it manages to arrive at some exciting new destinations.” — Charlie Jane Anders, Washington PostOcean's Godori Speculative Fiction? What's that? Do you like science fiction? That's speculative fiction. Fantasy? OK, that's speculative fiction too. Horror, magical realism, alternate history, slipstream, steampunk, cyberpunk, dystopias, apocalyptic tales, and stories that are just plain weird? Yep. Those are all eligible for our speculative fiction menu!If reading outside the lines of everyday life interests you, we invite you to join our online community as we explore our reading horizons.

      "description": "Everyone is welcome to join our online (Zoom) book discussion group on Wednesday May 13, 2026. For more information and a Zoom invite, contact Davo Knepler at nuevodavos@yahoo.com.We will be discussing California Dreaming by Noa Silber. Having grown up on stories of her mother's wild youth in California, Elena Berg relocates from New England to the Bay Area in 2011 for a placement as an English teacher with Teach for America. Once there, she is eager to inspire a love of poetry and literature in her diverse but underprivileged students. Her own grandfather--a Holocaust survivor--was a storyteller and teacher who touched the lives of his students for years to come. Elena's mother followed in his footsteps, leaving behind the hippie lifestyle of her twenties to become a university professor. But Elena quickly finds herself feeling disconnected from teaching, unable to inspire her students, and before long, she grows disillusioned with her career. She transitions to a role in an education technology startup--though she questions her decision, her motivations, and her values. Coming of age between the Occupy and #MeToo movements and against the backdrop of the 2016 election and California's ever-worsening fire season, Elena reckons with California as she imagined it and California as it really is. As she does so, she must also ultimately reconcile the person she envisioned herself to be with the person she actually is. For more information and a Zoom invite, contact Davo Knepler at nuevodavos@yahoo.com. Everyone is welcome to attend.

      "library_slug": "sno-isle",
      "description": "Join us to celebrate the love of reading with others in our community! The Lynnwood Library Book Group meets regularly on the second Monday of each month from 6:30-7:45pm. This month's selection is How to Age Disgracefully by Clare Pooley. Books are selected by members of the group and cover a variety of genres. When Lydia takes a job running the Senior Citizens' Social Club three afternoons a week, she assumes she'll be spending her time drinking tea and playing gentle games of cards. The members of the Social Club, however, are not at all what Lydia was expecting. From Art, a failed actor turned kleptomaniac to Daphne, who has been hiding from her dark past for decades to Ruby, a Banksy-style knitter who gets revenge in yarn, these seniors look deceptively benign--but when age makes you invisible, secrets are so much easier to hide. When the city council threatens to sell the doomed community center building, the members of the Social Club join forces with their tiny friends in the daycare next door--as well as the teenaged father of one of the toddlers and a geriatric dog--to save the building. Together, this group's unorthodox methods may actually work, as long as the police don't catch up with them first.View all of Lynnwood Library Book Group's 2026 selections.Contact us with questions Programs & Events FAQs To request a sign language interpreter, complete this online form or contact your local library at least two weeks prior to the library event.
