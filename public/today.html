Miele's autobiography talks about how he has negotiated life as a blind person in a world created for sighted people. A born problem solver and naturally curious Miele has spent his life not only figuring out how to live a full life, but helping other blind individuals do the same as an advocate for disability and accessibility. He chronicles the evolution of a number of revolutionary accessible technologies and his role in shaping them, including screen readers, tactile maps, and audio description. Along the way, he grappled with drugs and addiction, played bass in a rock band, worked for NASA, became a guerilla activist, and married the love of his life and had two children.
